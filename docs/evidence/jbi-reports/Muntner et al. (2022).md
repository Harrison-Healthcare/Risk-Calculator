# Muntner et al. (2022)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** Used NHANES, a nationally representative survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population.

**Sampling method appropriate (2/2):** NHANES applied multistage, stratified probability sampling, which is appropriate for generalizability.

**Sample size adequate (2/2):** Over 21,000 participants were included across multiple NHANES cycles, allowing for stable estimates even in stratified analyses.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Detailed sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and dietary variables were reported and stratified by age and BP status.

**Data analysis coverage adequate (2/2):** Analysis used complete-case methods with weighting and accounted for NHANES complex survey design. Missing diet data was transparently noted (21%).

**Valid methods for condition identification (2/2):** Blood pressure was measured up to 3 times per participant by trained professionals using validated protocols.

**Standard, reliable condition measurement (2/2):** BP measurements followed rigorous NHANES procedures; use of averaged measurements increased reliability.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Applied multinomial and logistic regression models with age-adjusted medication corrections and survey weights.

**Response rate adequate and managed (2/2):** NHANES maintains high participation and adherence to NCHS data quality and response standards; analyses accounted for sampling weights and bias.
