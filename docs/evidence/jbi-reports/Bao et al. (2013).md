# Bao et al. (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** Clearly posed objective to assess the relationship between diabetes mellitus and both incidence and mortality of kidney cancer.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included case-control and cohort studies with reported risk estimates and 95% CIs for kidney cancer incidence or mortality associated with diabetes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched PubMed from 1960–2012 using MeSH and keyword combinations, supplemented by reference list reviews.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** Single database (PubMed) may limit scope, but adequate for focused biomedical question.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (2/2):** Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), explicit item-level criteria and thresholds were not provided.

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (2/2):** Two reviewers extracted data and assessed quality, but independence and arbitration procedures were not clearly stated.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Detailed extraction protocol including study characteristics, exposure ascertainment, and adjusted estimates.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis with subgroup, stratified, and sensitivity analyses including by geography, gender, and confounder control.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Funnel plot and Egger’s test used; no evidence of publication bias (p = 0.780).

**Recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Conclusions consistent with pooled results, but the impact of potential biases (e.g., surveillance bias, residual confounding) not systematically evaluated.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Calls for better diabetes classification, drug effect assessment, and prospective studies to clarify mortality link.
