# Lugo et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly articulated aim to assess smoking and pancreatic cancer dose-response relationship.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Studies had to be observational, in humans, and report or permit derivation of RR/OR with CIs.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Literature search across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and key gray literature sources.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Employed both umbrella and updated systematic review strategies, drawing on 171 studies.

**Appraisal criteria appropriate (0/2):** Authors deliberately did not assign quality scores or use formal risk-of-bias tools.

**Independent critical appraisal (1/2):** Independent dual screening for inclusion, but no formal risk-of-bias assessment conducted.

**Minimized extraction errors (2/2):** Data extraction was clearly described, standardized, and overseen by statisticians.

**Combination of studies appropriate (2/2):** Used advanced random-effects and one-stage dose–response models with restricted cubic splines.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Egger’s test and funnel plots were conducted for several comparisons (e.g., current vs. never smokers).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Interpretation of risk gradients aligns with modeled results and statistical trends.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Recommended future work to improve exposure classification and confounding control.
