### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similar groups (2/2):** All participants were normotensive at baseline with no stroke history; inclusion criteria were uniform across the cohort.

**Exposure measured similarly (2/2):** Risk factors assessed via standardized questionnaire and clinical exams for all.

**Exposure measured validly/reliably (2/2):** Standardized procedures for blood pressure, BMI, and questionnaire data (e.g., smoking, alcohol).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Key variables like age, education, smoking, BMI, BP, CHD, and diabetes identified.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox regression with backward selection used to control for confounders.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** History of stroke was an exclusion criterion.

**Valid/reliable outcome measurement (2/2):** Stroke defined by clinical signs >24h and verified via CT/autopsy/medical records.

**Outcome measurement consistent (2/2):** Data linked with the Malmö Stroke Register and National Hospital Discharge Register.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up was 5.7 years, enough to observe stroke outcomes.

**Follow-up completeness (1/2):** Exclusions due to missing data were mentioned, but strategies for handling attrition not discussed.

**Statistical analysis appropriate (2/2):** Used Cox regression with appropriate significance thresholds and model refinement.
