# Cannon-Albright et al. (2019)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All probands drawn from the Utah Population Database, matched within genealogic and registry cohorts.

**Exposures measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** Family history of lung cancer uniformly measured via linked genealogical and cancer registry data.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Exposure data (family history constellations) derived from validated registry and genealogy sources.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Identification of potential confounders such as genetics and smoking.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors (0/2):** No statistical control or stratification by key confounders like tobacco use.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Only incident lung cancer cases were included; exposure assessed prior to outcome.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Lung cancer diagnoses confirmed by SEER-based registry with histopathological verification.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Cancer data from 1966 to ~2014 with multigenerational follow-up provides sufficient duration.

**Follow-up complete and reasons for loss described (1/2):** Unclear follow-up completeness; migration or missing data acknowledged as a limitation.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Acknowledges potential biases from missing or outdated data but does not address mitigation strategies.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cohort-specific lung cancer rates used as baseline; Poisson methods with confidence intervals calculated.

| Cannon-Albright et al. (2019) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 18/22 | 81.8% | Large population-based cohort using genealogic linkage and cancer registry; Item 5 – no strategies to adjust for confounding; Item 9 – follow-up status unclear; Item 10 – no discussion of loss to follow-up or strategies to address it. |
