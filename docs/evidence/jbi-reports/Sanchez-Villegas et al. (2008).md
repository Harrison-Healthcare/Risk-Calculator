### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were university graduates recruited into the SUN cohort using uniform methods, ensuring comparability.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** All participants completed the same validated physical activity questionnaire at baseline.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Leisure-time physical activity was measured using a MET-index questionnaire validated against accelerometers (ρ = 0.507).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Covariates included age, gender, smoking, marital status, BMI, comorbidities, energy intake, and alcohol use.

**Strategies to deal with confounders stated (2/2):** Multivariate logistic regression was adjusted for all listed confounders in models assessing the outcomes.

**Participants free of the outcome at the start (2/2):** All participants with mental health diagnoses or use of related medications at baseline were excluded.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident mental disorders were identified via self-reported physician diagnosis and validated medication usage, confirmed against DSM-IV SCID criteria.

**Follow-up time reported and long enough (2/2):** Follow-up spanned up to 6 years, allowing sufficient time for detection of incident mental disorders.

**Loss to follow-up addressed (2/2):** The overall retention rate was approximately 90%, with documented counts for different follow-up phases.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (1/2):** While retention was high, there was no detailed description of specific strategies or bias adjustment beyond descriptive attrition tracking.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Logistic regression with multiple confounders, trend tests, and joint exposure analysis were used appropriately.
