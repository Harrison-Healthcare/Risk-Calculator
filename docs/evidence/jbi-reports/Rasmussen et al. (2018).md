### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similarity of groups (2/2):** Participants were all from the Danish general population with uniform APOE genotype stratification and comparable baseline characteristics across groups (Table 1, page 3).

**Exposure measured similarly (2/2):** APOE genotypes assessed uniformly from blood samples using standardized lab protocols.

**Validity/reliability of exposure (2/2):** Genotyping followed validated SNP markers and APOE isoform distinctions; biochemical consistency was checked across cohorts.

**Confounders identified (2/2):** Comprehensive set of covariates considered: sex, BMI, diabetes, smoking, education, hypertension, physical activity, HRT, lipid therapy.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox regression and competing risks models; all models adjusted for key biological and behavioral covariates.

**Outcome-free at baseline (2/2):** Individuals without dementia or cerebrovascular disease were included at baseline; follow-up commenced at diagnosis-free entry.

**Outcome measurement (2/2):** Dementia diagnoses extracted from national patient and cause-of-death registries using validated ICD codes; 81% confirmation for Alzheimerâ€™s diagnoses.

**Sufficient follow-up (2/2):** Median follow-up ~38 years from registry start, with long tracking for late-onset dementia outcomes.

**Complete follow-up (2/2):** 100% follow-up ensured via national registries with no loss to follow-up.

**Addressing incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Not applicable; full follow-up achieved for all outcomes.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Competing risks models (Fine & Gray), Cox regression, sensitivity analyses, age-stratified absolute risks; full model justification provided.
