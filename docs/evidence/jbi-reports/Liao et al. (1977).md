### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similar groups recruited from the same population (2/2):** All probands selected from the Family Heart Study with clear inclusion criteria.

**Exposures measured similarly for all (2/2):** Standardized, self-administered questionnaires used across all participants to assess familial stroke history.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Family history assessed directly from relatives, reducing bias; agreement levels (kappa > 0.7) support reliability.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Key covariates including age, sex, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, CHD, cholesterol, and smoking were specified.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable logistic regression used with two levels of adjustment (demographics and full clinical covariates).

**Participants free of the outcome at the start (2/2):** Only prevalent stroke status reported; design focused on cross-sectional prevalence but derived from a cohort setting.

**Outcomes measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Stroke history obtained via direct self-report; prior validation suggests high sensitivity and specificity.

**Outcome measurement consistent across groups (2/2):** All probands and family members used the same assessment method.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** While not a longitudinal incidence study, data on adult stroke history in a large cohort provides sufficient exposure-to-outcome window.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (1/2):** 24 probands were excluded due to missing data, but loss to follow-up not discussed in detail.

**Statistical analysis appropriate (2/2):** Multivariable logistic regression and interaction testing used effectively; model specifications clearly described.
