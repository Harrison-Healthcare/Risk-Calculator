# Pinsky et al. (2003)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants were part of the PLCO screening trial with shared eligibility criteria and demographics.

**Exposure measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** All subjects completed the same self-administered baseline questionnaire with standardized coding protocols.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (1/2):** Family history was self-reported without external validation, introducing possible recall and misclassification bias.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Sex, race/ethnicity, age, and education were identified and analyzed as key covariates.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Controlled for confounders using stratified logistic regression and adjusted comparisons.

**Groups free of outcome at start (2/2):** Study examined baseline exposure (family history reporting); no prior outcome dependency.

**Outcomes measured validly and reliably (1/2):** Outcome was indirectly assessed using SEER-based expected values; not validated per participant.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Exposure and outcome both assessed at baseline; follow-up duration not required for this design.

**Follow-up complete (1/2):** Loss to follow-up not explicitly discussed; 96% of participants completed the baseline survey.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No mention of handling missing or nonrespondent data; default 1/2 per user rule.

**Statistical analysis appropriate (2/2):** Used logistic regression, Poisson CI modeling, and stratified SEER comparisons for internal validation.
