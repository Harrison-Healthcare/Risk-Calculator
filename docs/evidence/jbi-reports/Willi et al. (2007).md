# Willi et al. (2007)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The authors aimed to quantify the association between active smoking and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes using cohort data.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included only prospective cohort studies with clearly defined exposure (smoking) and outcomes (diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism) in non-diabetic adults at baseline.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Conducted systematic searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE with supplemental reference checking and expert consultation. Boolean logic was fully outlined in the methods section.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** The search strategy incorporated broad database coverage and additional grey literature sources, maximizing study capture.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Study quality was evaluated based on criteria including outcome assessment method, confounder adjustment, follow-up duration, and dropout rates, detailed in Table 2.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data with high interrater reliability (94–96% agreement), and disagreements resolved via consensus.

**Methods to minimize data extraction error (2/2):** Used structured data forms and dual extraction, ensuring accurate capture of effect estimates, exposure classifications, and covariate adjustments.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Pooled relative risks were calculated using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed (I² = 75.5%), and subgroup/dose-response/sensitivity analyses were performed (Figures 2–3).

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Publication bias was tested using funnel plots, Begg’s and Egger’s tests, and adjusted using trim-and-fill methods. No significant bias was detected.

**Recommendations for policy/practice supported by data (2/2):** The conclusion that smoking is a modifiable diabetes risk factor aligns with the consistent association found across studies.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Future research should explore the mechanisms linking smoking and diabetes, as well as potential residual confounding from unmeasured variables.

| Willi et al. (2007) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 22/22 | 100% | High-quality meta-analysis of 25 prospective cohort studies (n > 1.2 million) evaluating smoking as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Strong design, complete bias assessments, validated exposure/outcome criteria, and extensive sensitivity analyses meet all JBI criteria. |
