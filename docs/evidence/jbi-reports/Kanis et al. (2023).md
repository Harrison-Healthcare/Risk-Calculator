### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Aimed to quantify fracture risk associated with prior fracture across global cohorts to update FRAX.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included prospective cohorts with ≥200 participants and data on fracture outcomes and clinical risk factors.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic review registered with PROSPERO and based on a prior cohort selection strategy.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Analysis included over 2.1 million individuals from 64 cohorts across 32 countries.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (1/2):** Cohort quality was graded, but no formal appraisal tool (e.g., NOS) was reported.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Quality scoring criteria were clearly defined and summarized by study design.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Primary data used where available; central modeling procedures and harmonization across cohorts.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Extended Poisson regression and random-effects meta-analysis conducted with adjustment for covariates and cohort heterogeneity.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Study mitigated publication bias by including unpublished data and using primary data rather than relying solely on published estimates.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Adjusted hazard ratios for fracture risk are thoroughly detailed by sex, age, time, and BMD; implications for FRAX discussed throughout.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Advocates FRAX model improvements (e.g., recency, number of prior fractures, BMD-independent risk), and introduces potential for FRAXplus adjustments.
