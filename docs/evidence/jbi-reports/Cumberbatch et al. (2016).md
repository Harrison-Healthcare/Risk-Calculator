# Cumberbatch et al. (2016)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** Focused on quantifying the relationship between tobacco use and bladder/kidney cancer incidence and mortality.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included human studies reporting RR/OR/HR for cancer incidence or DSM, excluding molecular/cell-line studies.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic search conducted in PubMed using defined terms for both cancers.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** PubMed used exclusively, which may be a limitation, but is acceptable for the defined scope.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (0/2):** No mention of using a formal appraisal tool or process for included studies.

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (1/2):** Selection was done by one reviewer; no explicit evidence of dual independent appraisal.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Extracted risk estimates, cancer type, tobacco product, exposure classification, and adjustment variables.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Pooled estimates using random-effects models; stratified analyses by region, gender, smoking status.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Used Begg and Egger tests; funnel plots noted, with acknowledgment of bias in BC data.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Cessation benefits clearly quantified; stratified results consistent with conclusions.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Identified evidence gaps (e.g., SHS, dose-response, subtype differences) and suggested directions.
