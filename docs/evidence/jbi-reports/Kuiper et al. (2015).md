# Kuiper et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Yes. The review aimed to investigate whether different aspects of poor social relationships are associated with increased risk of incident dementia.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Yes. Included peer-reviewed longitudinal cohort studies of general populations measuring baseline social relationships and incident dementia.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Systematic search in MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO using detailed terms for social relationships and dementia; also followed PRISMA guidelines.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Yes. Multiple databases searched, supplemented by citation chasing and inclusion of studies in four languages.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Study quality was assessed using the QUIPS tool, and methodological issues were reported clearly in Table 2 and discussed in-depth.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Yes. Two reviewers independently performed selection, extraction, and quality assessment with a third arbitrating disagreements.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Yes. Data were extracted using structured methods by two reviewers independently; discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Random-effects models were used; heterogeneity tested via I² and Q-statistics; subgroup and sensitivity analyses thoroughly conducted.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Yes. Funnel plots and Egger’s tests were performed (e.g., p = 0.08 for social participation); bias discussed explicitly in Section 3.8 and Appendix E.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Yes. The review recommends considering social interaction as a modifiable dementia risk factor, comparable in magnitude to depression or low education.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Suggested interventions targeting social interaction and the use of life-course approaches in dementia prevention.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kuiper et al. (2015) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 22/22 | 100% | High-quality meta-analysis of 19 longitudinal cohort studies linking poor social relationships (e.g., low participation, loneliness) with incident dementia. Methodological rigor, thorough sensitivity analysis, and extensive exploration of heterogeneity fully meet all criteria. |
