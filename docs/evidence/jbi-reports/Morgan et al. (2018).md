### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Criteria for inclusion clearly defined (2/2):** Only unrelated white British individuals were included, as defined by self-report and PCA clustering.

**Study subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** 343,234 participants from UK Biobank detailed by gender, ancestry, and phenotype distributions (Table 1, page 2).

**Exposure measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Genotypes for >800,000 SNPs assayed using validated UK Biobank genotyping arrays with imputation quality >0.9.

**Objective, standard criteria used for measurement of condition (2/2):** Hair colour based on standardized UK Biobank self-report question before greying.

**Confounding factors identified (1/2):** While covariates (e.g., ancestry PCs, sex) were controlled for, the study does not explicitly identify all potential confounders such as age or UV exposure.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** Models adjusted for the first 15 genetic PCs and genotyping batch to address population structure.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Genetic loci associated with hair colour identified using established GWAS significance thresholds and validated models.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Logistic regression, conditional GWAS, polygenic scoring, eQTL colocalisation, and enrichment analysis—all methods are rigorous and appropriate.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Morgan et al. (2018) | JBI Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies | 15/16 | 93.8% | High-quality GWAS of hair colour using UK Biobank. Valid exposure/outcome measures and advanced statistical control for confounding. Item 5 – potential confounding factors not explicitly listed, though adjusted for in models. |
