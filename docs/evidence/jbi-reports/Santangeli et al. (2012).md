# Santangeli et al. (2012)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** The aim was to assess whether AF increases the risk of dementia in patients without baseline cognitive impairment or stroke.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Strict inclusion: prospective design, stroke-free at baseline, normal cognition, and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Comprehensive search across multiple databases from 1980–2012 with no language restriction.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, ISI Web of Science, and major cardiology and neurology society archives were searched.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane method.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Standardized forms and dual extraction were used; disagreements resolved by consensus.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis using inverse variance weighting; appropriate for observed heterogeneity.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Assessed graphically (funnel plot) and statistically (Egger’s test, p=0.83).

**Were the recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Suggested that AF patients should be screened for dementia and that future trials should include dementia as an outcome.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Called for randomized trials and observational cohorts to evaluate whether treating AF reduces dementia risk.
