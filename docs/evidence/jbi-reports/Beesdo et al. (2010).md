### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants aged 14â€“24 were recruited from a representative community sample in Munich, Germany, using stratified methods.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** All individuals were evaluated using the M-CIDI across all waves, ensuring exposure classification consistency.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Standardized DSM-IV-based interviews using the Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview (DIA-X/M-CIDI) were administered by trained clinicians.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** The study explicitly analyzed familial, temperamental, and environmental risk factors, such as parental mental illness, behavioral inhibition, and family functioning.

**Strategies to deal with confounders stated (2/2):** Statistical adjustments were made using Cox regressions stratified by age and sex, and comorbidity adjustments were included.

**Participants free of the outcome at the start (2/2):** Analyses considered only incident cases from baseline onward; prior disorder presence was accounted for in hazard models.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Diagnostic outcomes were derived from structured DSM-IV interviews with known validity and good inter-rater reliability.

**Follow-up time reported and long enough (2/2):** Up to four assessments over 10 years were completed, allowing for long-term incidence tracking.

**Loss to follow-up addressed (2/2):** Overall response rate was 92.6% with low attrition bias; no selective loss based on diagnostic group was detected.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Extensive tracking methods and data imputation procedures were described and implemented across waves.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regressions with time-dependent covariates and robust standard error adjustments were used to test risk associations.
