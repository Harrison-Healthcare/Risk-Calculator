# Gandini et al. (2005)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Focused on phenotypic and familial risk factors for cutaneous melanoma.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included 60 studies with defined criteria for exposure and confirmed melanoma.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search with no time/language restrictions across multiple databases.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Search included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and previous reviews.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal critical appraisal or risk-of-bias assessment reported for included studies.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by two or more reviewers (0/2):** No mention of reviewer independence during screening or data extraction.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized data extraction and use of summary measures (e.g., pooled RRs).

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Fixed and random effects, meta-regression, heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were used.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Publication bias tested via funnel plots, Begg’s and Egger’s tests, and Trim-and-Fill method.

**Recommendations supported by reported data (2/2):** Findings regarding traits like red hair, freckles, and nevi are supported by pooled estimates.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Recommendations included gene-environment interaction research and phenotypic subtyping.
