# Niedhammer et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** The SIP survey selected a representative French working population, and participants were all actively employed at both waves.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** All occupational factors were self-reported using a standardized format in both 2006 and 2010.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Psychosocial exposures followed established models (e.g., job strain, effort-reward imbalance) and were supplemented with emergent factors.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Covariates included gender, age, occupation, marital status, children, social support, and life events.

**Strategies to deal with confounders stated (2/2):** All regression models adjusted for these covariates; sensitivity analyses added employment and health-related covariates.

**Participants free of the outcome at the start (2/2):** The analytic sample excluded individuals with prior MDD or GAD diagnoses at baseline.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Diagnoses of MDD and GAD were made using the MINI structured interview aligned with DSM-IV, validated in French.

**Follow-up time reported and long enough (2/2):** The study followed participants over 4 years, a sufficient window to detect incident mental disorders.

**Loss to follow-up addressed (2/2):** A follow-up rate of 81% was achieved, and response bias was controlled using inverse probability weighting and marginal calibration.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness, including non-working participants at follow-up and adjusting for attrition bias.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Multivariate weighted logistic regression was used, including tests for linear trends and repeated exposure modeling.
