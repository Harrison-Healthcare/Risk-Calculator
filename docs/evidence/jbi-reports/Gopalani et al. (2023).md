### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Appropriate sample frame (2/2):** The BRFSS includes a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, well aligned with the target population of women aged ≥18 years.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** Participants were selected via stratified random sampling using state-level surveillance systems.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** Over 1.2 million respondents across years; clearly sufficient to ensure narrow confidence intervals.

**Subjects and setting described (2/2):** The study details age, race/ethnicity, geography, and survey years; all essential characteristics are reported.

**Sufficient coverage of sample (2/2):** The analysis includes stratification and weighting to ensure coverage across population subgroups.

**Valid methods to identify condition (1/2):** Hysterectomy status was self-reported; while prior validation supports accuracy, it remains a potential source of misclassification.

**Reliable measurement for all participants (2/2):** All respondents were asked identical BRFSS questions using a standardized protocol.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Age-standardization, Wald F tests, and SUDAAN for complex survey design were correctly used.

**Adequate response rate and handling of low response (1/2):** BRFSS uses raking to adjust for nonresponse, but detailed comparison of responders vs non-responders was not reported.

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gopalani et al. (2023) | JBI Checklist for Prevalence Studies | 16/18 | 88.9% | Large, representative BRFSS dataset with age-standardized prevalence estimates and trends over time. Item 6 – self-reported hysterectomy may introduce misclassification bias; Item 9 – response bias acknowledged, but nonresponse adjustment (raking) applied. |
