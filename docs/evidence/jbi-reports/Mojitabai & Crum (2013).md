# Mojitabai & Crum (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Yes. Data came from the nationally representative NESARC sample of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years, recruited using stratified multistage probability sampling.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Yes. Smoking exposure was defined consistently using self-report of smoking frequency and quantity across the follow-up window.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Yes. Smoking status and cigarette quantity were measured using detailed, standardized questions at both baseline and follow-up, with validated categorization methods.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Yes. Adjusted for a wide range of sociodemographic, physical health, and psychiatric covariates, including alcohol/substance use and lifetime mental health history.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Yes. Multivariable logistic regression and instrumental variable analyses were used to address observed and unobserved confounding (e.g., using state cigarette tax and public attitudes).

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Yes. Analyses excluded individuals with a history of each mental disorder at baseline from the respective outcome analyses.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Yes. Mental disorders were assessed using the AUDADIS-IV structured interview, consistent with DSM-IV criteria and validated in prior studies.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Yes. Participants were followed for 3 years (2001–2005), sufficient to detect onset of common psychiatric disorders.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Yes. Of the original 43,093 participants, 34,653 were re-interviewed; exclusions and response rates were fully described (95.7% of those eligible included in final analysis).

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Yes. Used survey weights to adjust for design and attrition, and excluded those with missing or inconsistent smoking data.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Yes. Used survey-weighted logistic regression, instrumental variable probit models, interaction analyses, and stratified subgroup analyses.

| Mojtabai & Crum (2013) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 22/22 | 100% | Excellent cohort study using NESARC data to examine associations between cigarette smoking and onset of mood/anxiety disorders. Large, nationally representative sample, strong confounder control, and longitudinal design fully meet JBI criteria. |
