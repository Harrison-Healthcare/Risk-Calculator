### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Explicit goal to assess colorectal cancer risk across light, moderate, and heavy alcohol intake, including dose–response modeling .

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Only observational studies with ≥3 alcohol consumption levels and relative risk estimates included, based on MOOSE guidelines.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Systematic PubMed search through May 2010 plus manual reference screening, including non-English studies when data were available in English.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Included global cohort and case-control studies; 61 total, from Asia, Europe, North America, and Australia.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Study quality scored (0–10 scale) based on exposure ascertainment and analysis adjustment; presented in Tables 1 and 2.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers (2/2):** Data abstraction and quality scoring performed independently with consensus resolution.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Central recoding, harmonized alcohol units (g/day), standardized conversions, and statistical corrections for open-ended categories.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Used both categorical and fractional polynomial dose–response meta-analysis with random effects modeling and meta-regression.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Egger's test, Begg’s test, trim-and-fill method, and funnel plots used; minimal bias found.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Strong evidence that moderate and heavy drinking increase CRC risk; even 10 g/day shows 7% increased risk in dose–response model.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Advocates for better stratified data (by sex, subsite, folate, genetics), studies in underrepresented regions (e.g., South America, Africa), and lifetime exposure analysis.
