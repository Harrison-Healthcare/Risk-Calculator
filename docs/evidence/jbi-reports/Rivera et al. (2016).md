# Rivera et al. (2016)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear review question (2/2):** The study sought to evaluate the association between adiposity and risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using pooled data from two large prospective cohorts.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Clearly defined criteria for participant selection in NHS and HPFS cohorts, with baseline exclusions noted (e.g., history of cancer, missing BMI).

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** The study uses existing cohort data rather than a traditional database search, but the cohorts are well-established and cover the population comprehensively for the intended analyses.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Data pooled from two large-scale prospective U.S. cohorts (NHS and HPFS), representing high-quality longitudinal resources.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (2/2):** As a pooled analysis, not a systematic review of external studies, appraisal was not required.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers (2/2):** Not applicable due to the design; however, statistical analyses and data management suggest rigorous methodological oversight.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Data from NHS and HPFS were collected via validated questionnaires with high follow-up rates.

**Methods for combining studies appropriate (2/2):** Pooled analysis using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by cohort, adjusted for known confounders.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Not explicitly tested via funnel plot or Egger's test, but irrelevant here as the study did not involve aggregating findings from multiple independent publications.

**Heterogeneity assessed (2/2):** Stratified analyses and interaction tests performed (e.g., by sex and skin phenotype) to evaluate heterogeneity.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Conclusions align with results showing no clear link between BMI and BCC/SCC risk; consistent across cohorts and subgroups.

**Specific directives for policy/practice (2/2):** Implications discussed in terms of clinical relevance; recommend no weight-based adjustment for skin cancer risk.

**Appropriate review of risk of bias (2/2):** Analyses addressed potential confounding (e.g., UV exposure, skin phenotype) and applied consistent measurement methods across cohorts.

**Strategies for dealing with bias discussed (2/2):** Strengths and limitations addressed, including self-reported BMI and residual confounding.
