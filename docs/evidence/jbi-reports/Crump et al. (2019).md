### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All singleton live births in Sweden, 1973–2014; exclusion of multiples enhances comparability.

**Exposures measured similarly for groups (2/2):** Gestational age estimated consistently using last menstrual period and ultrasound where available.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Gestational age data obtained from the well-established Swedish Birth Registry.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Includes maternal age, education, BMI, smoking, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth, etc.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** Adjusted Cox regression models and co-sibling analyses to control for shared familial factors.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Incident hypertension diagnoses recorded from birth onwards via national health registries.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Diagnoses coded using ICD versions 8–10 across national inpatient, outpatient, and primary care registries.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up of 22.5 years, up to 43 years.

**Follow-up complete, or differences described (1/2):** Emigration and death were handled in censoring, but coverage variation in outpatient data (72%) could lead to under-ascertainment.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up utilized (2/2):** Sensitivity analysis restricting to fully covered periods (from 2001) showed similar results.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Time-to-event Cox regression, risk differences, and co-sibling stratified models were appropriately applied.
