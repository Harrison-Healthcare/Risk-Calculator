# Launer et al. (1999)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** The study aims to estimate incidence rates of dementia and assess the risk of AD associated with family history, sex, education, smoking, and head trauma.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Inclusion required prospective, population-based cohorts of individuals aged ≥65 with dementia-free baseline and follow-up using standardized diagnostic criteria.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Not a traditional search; instead, the EURODEM network pooled internal datasets with harmonized protocols across four cohorts from Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the UK.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** While not literature-based, the study included all available European cohorts fitting the EURODEM harmonization framework.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (0/2):** No formal checklist-based appraisal of individual cohort quality was described, though interrater reliability and diagnostic consistency checks were conducted.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (1/2):** No formal critical appraisal was conducted, but a EURODEM consensus panel independently reviewed diagnosis data and resolved difficult cases, showing good interrater agreement (kappa 0.66–0.78).

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Each center recoded data using a common format and sent it to a centralized data management team for consistency checks.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Log-linear and Poisson regression models were used; rates standardized by age and site; interaction terms assessed heterogeneity across cohorts.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** As this was not a publication-based meta-analysis, publication bias was not applicable; selection bias from study inclusion was mitigated by design.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Recommendations were grounded in the findings — notably about sex-specific risk, impact of education, and correcting previous assumptions about smoking and head trauma.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Authors called for future studies to incorporate APOE genotype, gene-environment interactions, and more precise assessment of head trauma and familial risk.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Launer et al. (1999) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 19/22 | 86.4% | Excellent pooled analysis of four European prospective cohorts assessing dementia and AD risk factors. Item 5 – while study quality was managed (e.g., interrater reliability), formal appraisal criteria were not explicitly described. Item 6 – formal appraisal criteria were not described, but presence of two independent reviewers. |
