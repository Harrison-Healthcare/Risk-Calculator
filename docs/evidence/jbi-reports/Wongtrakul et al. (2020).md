# Wongtrakul et al. (2020)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Investigated the risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture in patients with IBS.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included cohort and cross-sectional studies comparing IBS and non-IBS populations with osteoporosis/fracture outcomes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar with no language restrictions; supplementary strategies were used.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Final analysis included 5 eligible studies with over 526,000 participants across the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Used Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and a modified version for cross-sectional studies (Table 1).

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Two authors conducted screening and quality scoring.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Dual reviewer extraction with discrepancies resolved by senior author.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used random-effects meta-analysis with DerSimonian and Laird method; heterogeneity assessed via I² and Cochran’s Q.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Not performed due to small number of studies, but rationale clearly stated.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Data supported increased osteoporosis risk (RR 1.95) and trend toward increased fracture risk (RR 1.58), with subgroup analyses conducted.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Recommends further studies to validate findings and assess interventions for IBS patients at risk.
