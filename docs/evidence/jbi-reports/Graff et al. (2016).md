### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, ensuring group comparability.

**Exposures measured similarly (2/2):** Biennial questionnaires used consistently to assess statin use.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Self-reported statin use previously validated against pharmacy data.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Potential confounders such as age, BMI, comorbidities, and PSA screening explicitly addressed.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox regression and stratified analyses employed.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Excluded men with previous prostate cancer diagnoses.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Prostate cancer outcomes confirmed via medical and pathology records.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Extended follow-up with median durations over 10 years.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Follow-up procedures outlined, with low attrition due to study design.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No sensitivity analyses or imputation reported for any potential losses.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Time-to-event data analyzed with appropriate Cox models and splines.
