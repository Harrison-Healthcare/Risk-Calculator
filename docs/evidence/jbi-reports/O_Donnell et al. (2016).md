### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups comparable other than disease status (2/2):** Cases and controls were matched on age and sex and recruited concurrently from the same settings across 32 countries.

**Cases and controls matched appropriately (2/2):** Age and sex matching was explicitly described, with ±5 years (±10 years if >90).

**Same criteria used for identification (2/2):** WHO clinical criteria for stroke used for cases; controls were confirmed stroke-free.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Structured, standardized questionnaires and measurements applied across all sites.

**Exposure measured same way for both groups (2/2):** Identical instruments and protocols for both cases and controls.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Identified and adjusted for age, sex, and region; multivariate models included multiple risk factors.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable logistic regression and conditional matching were used.

**Outcomes assessed in a standard, valid and reliable way (2/2):** Neuroimaging confirmed stroke subtype for nearly all cases; standard WHO criteria used.

**Exposure period of interest meaningful (2/2):** Risk factors like hypertension, smoking, and lipids were measured to reflect long-term exposure relevant to stroke.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Multivariable conditional logistic regression, adjusted for key confounders and regional stratification; interaction tested.
