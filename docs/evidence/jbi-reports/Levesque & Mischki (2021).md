# Levesque & Mischki (2021)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** Used Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), which covers the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 6–79 years.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** Stratified multistage probability sampling; 16,606 participants over 3 survey cycles (2007–2013).

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** Very large national sample powered for subgroup analysis; >2,300 individuals used in final analytic sample after exclusions.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Participants classified by age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, dwelling type, and exposure location.

**Sufficient coverage of sample in analysis (2/2):** CHMS response rate was 52.9%; applied Statistics Canada weights and bootstrap variance estimation for national representation.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (2/2):** Used both self-reported exposure and urinary cotinine (COT), a validated biomarker for secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe).

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** Cotinine measured with ISO-accredited lab protocols and adjusted for urinary creatinine; questionnaire assessed SHSe frequency/location.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** SAS and SUDAAN with bootstrap variance estimation; geometric means and percentiles calculated, with significance tested via t-tests.

**Adequate response rate (2/2):** While response rate was moderate, robust weighting and calibration minimized bias; nearly complete biomonitoring coverage among eligible respondents.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Levesque & Mischki (2021) | JBI Checklist for Prevalence Studies | 18/18 | 100% | Nationally representative CHMS study using combined questionnaire and biomonitoring data. Cotinine analysis confirmed underreporting of SHSe, especially among children and apartment dwellers. Full methodological transparency and robust weighting. All checklist criteria clearly met. |
