# Hasin et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was the sample frame appropriate to address the target population? (2/2):** Yes. The study used data from the 2012–2013 NESARC-III, a nationally representative survey of U.S. civilian non-institutionalized adults aged 18+.

**Were study participants sampled in an appropriate way? (2/2):** Yes. A multistage probability sampling design was used, with oversampling of racial/ethnic minority groups to ensure representativeness.

**Was the sample size adequate? (2/2):** Yes. The final sample included 36,309 participants, which enabled precise prevalence estimates and stratified subgroup analysis.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Yes. Detailed demographic data (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education, marital status) and the sampling design were thoroughly reported (see Table 1, p. 4).

**Was the data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage of the identified sample? (2/2):** Yes. Response weights adjusted for nonresponse and oversampling; analyses covered the full eligible population and were conducted using SUDAAN to account for complex sampling design.

**Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition? (2/2):** Yes. MDD was diagnosed using the DSM-5–based AUDADIS-5, a validated structured interview with fair test-retest reliability (κ = 0.40) and improved dimensional validity (ICC = 0.59).

**Was the condition measured in a standard, reliable way for all participants? (2/2):** Yes. All participants received the same structured diagnostic interview (AUDADIS-5) administered by trained interviewers.

**Was there appropriate statistical analysis? (2/2):** Yes. Weighted prevalence estimates, adjusted odds ratios (aORs), and 95% CIs were calculated using multivariable logistic regression and SUDAAN software.

**Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low response rate managed appropriately? (2/2):** Yes. The overall response rate was 60.1%, and nonresponse weighting was applied; comparison with eligible population confirmed no major bias in key demographics.
