### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similar groups (2/2):** Cohort recruited from a homogenous population (NHSII female nurses) with exclusion of participants with cancer at baseline.

**Exposure measured similarly (2/2):** Tanning bed use assessed using a standardized questionnaire across all participants.

**Exposure measured validly/reliably (2/2):** Self-reported use with prior validation studies cited for reproducibility.

**Confounders identified (2/2):** Includes detailed covariates like hair color, mole count, UV exposure, and family history.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox models with thorough adjustment, plus pigment score stratification.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Excluded those with prior skin cancers at baseline.

**Valid/reliable outcome measurement (2/2):** Pathology-confirmed SCC and melanoma; BCC confirmed by prior validation studies.

**Outcome measurement consistent (2/2):** Standardized across cases via biennial questionnaires and medical record verification.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median 18.5 years, sufficient for skin cancer development.

**Follow-up completeness (1/2):** Follow-up duration reported, but limited details on attrition handling.

**Statistical analysis appropriate (2/2):** Cox models used with hazard ratios, interaction terms, and stratified analyses.

| Zhang et al. (2012) | JBI Cohort Studies Checklist | 21/22 | 95.5% | Strong methodological design using a large prospective cohort with validated exposure and outcome measures; long follow-up and adjustment for many confounders. Item 10 â€“ loss to follow-up discussed but lacks detailed strategies. |
