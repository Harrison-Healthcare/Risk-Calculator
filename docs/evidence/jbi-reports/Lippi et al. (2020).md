### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was the sample frame appropriate to address the target population? (2/2):** Data were sourced from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx), which includes surveys, censuses, and health statistics from all regions and income levels.

**Were study participants sampled in an appropriate way? (2/2):** AF cases were derived from large-scale international databases using consistent coding practices and modeling approaches, ensuring wide representation.

**Was the sample size adequate? (2/2):** The study includes global data representing millions of individuals across all major age groups and socio-demographic index levels.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Detailed breakdowns by age, sex, time period, and socio-demographic index (SDI) were provided (see Figures 2–3).

**Was the data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage of the identified sample? (2/2):** Data covered 1997–2017 trends globally, using robust modeling (DisMod-MR and CODEm) for consistency.

**Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition? (2/2):** AF and flutter were coded using ICD classifications and validated methods, harmonized across countries through GBD protocols.

**Was the condition measured in a standard, reliable way for all participants? (2/2):** The database and methodologies ensured consistency across time and geography.

**Was there appropriate statistical analysis? (2/2):** Incidence, prevalence, DALYs, and mortality were analyzed using linear regression and stratified by age, sex, and SDI with Pearson correlation reporting.

**Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low response rate managed appropriately? (0/2):** Not applicable in secondary database research—response rate is not discussed, nor relevant.
