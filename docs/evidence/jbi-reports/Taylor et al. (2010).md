### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All participants drawn from the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a linked genealogical and cancer registry covering a representative white Northern European population.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Family history (FDR, SDR, TDR constellations) determined using consistent genealogical linkage methods across the entire cohort.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Family relations and cancer diagnoses are verified through vital records and the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR), a SEER contributor since 1973.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Analyses stratified by age, gender, relationship type, and age at diagnosis; addressed via cohort-specific CRC rates.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Stratification by age and sex cohorts (n=264), and multivariate adjustment in FRR calculation, help mitigate bias.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Individuals were followed based on family history constellation regardless of disease status at baseline; CRC cases assessed as outcomes during follow-up.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** CRC diagnosis captured via UCR using standardized ICD-O coding; 94% of cancer cases linked to UPDB records.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Cancer records span 1952–2003; genealogical and registry data ensure long, retrospective follow-up for all participants.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** UPDB includes comprehensive population coverage with minimal outmigration and low inbreeding, ensuring robust longitudinal linkage.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No explicit methods described for managing loss to follow-up or incomplete genealogical links, though coverage was >94% for cancer cases.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Familial relative risks (FRRs) calculated using standardized morbidity ratio methods and stratified Poisson-based comparisons with 95% CIs.

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Taylor et al. (2010) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | Very large genealogical-linked cohort study from Utah with over 2.3 million participants. Exposure and outcome data are registry-based and highly reliable. Item 10 – no detailed discussion of handling missing outcome data or loss to follow-up, though registry completeness is high. |
