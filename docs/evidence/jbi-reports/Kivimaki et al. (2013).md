# Kivimaki et al. (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly defined objective to assess whether healthy lifestyle mitigates job strain's effect on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included participants free of CAD at baseline with complete data on job strain, lifestyle risk factors, and outcomes across 7 European cohorts.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Used a targeted inclusion of well-established cohorts from the IPD-Work Consortium; search strategy aligned with IPD meta-analysis design.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Included high-quality cohorts: Whitehall II, GAZEL, Belstress, WOLF (Stockholm & Norrland), Finnish Public Sector Study, and HeSSup.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Only cohorts with validated job strain measures and long-term follow-up were included.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Measures were harmonized before outcome assessment, minimizing bias; multistage review process outlined.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Data harmonization performed before analysis; exposures categorized identically across studies.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Used Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, cohort, and socioeconomic status; included HR, 95% CI, and population attributable risk estimates.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Publication bias unlikely due to inclusion of unpublished cohort data and pre-registered analysis protocols.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Participants with job strain and unhealthy lifestyles had a 2.69x higher risk of CHD (95% CI: 1.94–3.73) vs. those with healthy lifestyle and no job strain.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Encourages integrated interventions addressing both psychosocial stress and lifestyle behaviors.

| Kivimäki et al. (2013) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Pooled data from 7 prospective cohorts (n = 102,128) via the IPD-Work Consortium. Job strain and lifestyle risk factors (smoking, inactivity, obesity, heavy drinking) independently predicted CHD risk. Strong exposure harmonization, cohort consistency, and multivariable adjustment. All criteria fully satisfied. |
