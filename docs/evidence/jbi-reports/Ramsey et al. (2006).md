# Ramsey et al. (2006)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** The study used the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a well-established national survey with stratified sampling to reflect the civilian U.S. population.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** NHIS employs a stratified cluster sample design; all respondents are sampled via a robust national protocol.

**Adequate sample size (1/2):** While the study involved ~27,000 respondents, no formal sample size calculation or justification for statistical power was provided.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Clear description of age, sex, race, and income demographics; results stratified across multiple subgroups.

**Sufficient coverage of sample in analysis (2/2):** Weighting and design effects accounted for in SAS SURVEYFREQ analyses to extrapolate to national estimates.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (2/2):** Family history of cancer determined via self-reported presence of cancer in first-degree relatives; type-specific prompts were used.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** Family history is inherently self-reported, but validated against registry data in prior studies with high reliability for most cancer sites.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Weighted prevalence estimates with 95% CIs calculated using complex survey analysis procedures in SAS.

**Adequate response rate (1/2):** No mention of response rates or assessment of nonresponse bias, although NHIS typically maintains high completion rates.
