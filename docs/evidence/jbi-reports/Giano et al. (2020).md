### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was the sample frame appropriate to address the target population? (2/2):** Yes. The study used the CDC's BRFSS, a large, nationally representative surveillance system targeting non-institutionalized U.S. adults across 34 states.

**Were study participants sampled in an appropriate way? (2/2):** Yes. A multistage probability design (landline and cellular) was used, stratified by demographic variables to ensure geographic and population representativeness.

**Was the sample size adequate? (2/2):** Yes. Over 211,000 adults were included, with narrow confidence intervals and subgroup estimates across race, age, income, region, and sexual orientation.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Yes. Detailed demographic breakdowns were provided in Table 2 (page 6) and stratified by multiple sociodemographic groups.

**Was the data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage of the identified sample? (2/2):** Yes. Weighted frequencies and means were used to adjust for complex sampling and demographic nonresponse.

**Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition? (2/2):** Yes. ACEs were measured using 11 standard questions from the BRFSS optional module, covering 8 validated domains including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction.

**Was the condition measured in a standard, reliable way for all participants? (2/2):** Yes. All respondents were asked the same standardized BRFSS ACE items, and ACE scores were calculated following CDC guidelines.

**Was there appropriate statistical analysis? (2/2):** Yes. Weighted descriptive statistics and post-estimation F-tests were used for subgroup comparisons, including stratification and CI overlap methods.

**Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low response rate managed appropriately? (2/2):** Yes. Although specific response rates were not detailed per state, the BRFSS includes nonresponse weighting, and the final sample spanned 34 states over 9 years (2009â€“2017).

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Giano et al. (2020) | JBI Checklist for Prevalence Studies | 18/18 | 100% | Excellent prevalence study using BRFSS data from 34 U.S. states (n = 211,376) to report ACEs. Comprehensive sampling, validated measures, appropriate weighting, and stratified estimates across sociodemographics meet all JBI criteria. |
