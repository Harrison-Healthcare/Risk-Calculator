# Mortensen & Nordestgaard (2020)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** All participants were from the Copenhagen General Population Study, randomly selected from the Danish Civil Registry to represent the general population.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** LDL cholesterol levels were measured using standardized hospital assays consistently throughout the study.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald equation or measured directly when needed; biochemical assays were under rigorous internal and external control.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Confounders like age, sex, smoking, HDL cholesterol, BMI, hypertension, and eGFR were explicitly identified and adjusted for.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Multivariable Cox models with adjustment and multiple imputation were applied to address confounding and missing covariates.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** All individuals were free of ASCVD and diabetes at baseline.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Outcomes (MI, ASCVD) were ascertained through validated national Danish registries with high predictive value.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up was 7.7 years, adequate for observing cardiovascular outcomes.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (1/2):** Follow-up was near-complete (only 412 emigrants), but reasons for incomplete follow-up were not elaborated.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Competing risk models were used, but no specific methods were described for loss due to emigration.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression, competing risk (Fine-Gray) analysis, and multiple imputation were appropriately applied.
