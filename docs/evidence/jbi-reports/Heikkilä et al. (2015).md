# Heikkilä et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clearly focuses on prevalence/incidence of fractures in people with celiac disease.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Observational studies comparing individuals with and without celiac disease included.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Multiple databases searched with no language restrictions.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** 16 studies included from diverse settings and populations.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No quality appraisal criteria or tool was applied to included studies.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Dual screening and extraction occurred, but not for study quality.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized forms and conflict resolution used.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used random-effects models and meta-regression to assess heterogeneity.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s test applied.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Summary estimates and biological mechanisms clearly tied to results.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Emphasized need for future studies on undiagnosed disease and fracture mechanisms.

| Heikkilä et al. (2015) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Strong meta-analysis on celiac disease and fractures; comprehensive search and rigorous synthesis; Item 5 – no formal study quality appraisal; Item 6 – independent screening reported, but no independent quality appraisal. |
