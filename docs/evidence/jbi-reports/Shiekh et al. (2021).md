# Shiekh et al. (2021)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Yes. The review aimed to assess ethnic differences in the age-adjusted or age-specific incidence and prevalence of dementia globally.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Included peer-reviewed, population-based observational studies with ≥100 participants comparing at least two ethnic groups in adults aged ≥18.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Searched seven databases from inception to September 2019 using tailored search terms for dementia, ethnicity, and prevalence/incidence. Search strategies were documented.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Comprehensive database coverage (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Global Health, Web of Science) plus hand-searching of references.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Used a custom template derived from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and ROBINS-I, assessing confounding, misclassification, missing data, reverse causation, and power.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Yes. Risk of bias and data extraction were conducted by two reviewers independently; disagreements resolved via a third author.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Standardized Excel-based extraction template was pilot-tested; 10% of studies were double extracted.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Pooled risk ratios were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis; heterogeneity assessed via I² statistics; subgroup meta-analyses by ethnicity were reported.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Publication bias was not tested due to an insufficient number of studies per comparison group, but this limitation was transparently reported.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Yes. The study concluded that Black groups had a 30% higher dementia incidence, suggesting a need for targeted interventions and better representation in research.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Called for more granular ethnic data, longitudinal designs, exploration of healthcare access disparities, and investigation of modifiable risk factor clustering.
