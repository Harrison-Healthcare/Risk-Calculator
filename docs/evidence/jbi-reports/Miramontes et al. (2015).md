# Miramontes et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was the sample frame appropriate? (2/2):** The study used NHANES 2011–2012, a complex, stratified, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.

**Were study participants sampled appropriately? (2/2):** NHANES ensured population representativeness through oversampling of key subgroups and multi-level sampling design.

**Was the sample size adequate? (2/2):** Over 9,700 individuals were surveyed, with >6,000 tested with both TST and IGRA, providing sufficient precision for subgroup estimates.

**Were the study subjects and setting described in detail? (2/2):** Participants were described by age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and birthplace; detailed subgroup estimates were provided (Tables 1–5).

**Was the data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage of the identified sample? (2/2):** Sample weights and complex design corrections were applied to ensure generalizability and accuracy.

**Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition? (2/2):** TB infection assessed using TST and FDA-approved IGRA (QFT-GIT), both applied with standardized protocols.

**Was the condition measured in a standard, reliable way for all participants? (2/2):** TSTs and IGRAs conducted using rigorous CDC and laboratory procedures, with quality assurance (e.g., double readings, digit preference smoothing).

**Was there appropriate statistical analysis? (2/2):** Weighted estimates, multivariate corrections for nonresponse, and digit preference models were applied using R and validated methods.

**Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low response rate managed appropriately? (2/2):** TST response was 78.4%, IGRA 90.9%; nonresponse bias was adjusted using logistic regression-based weighting.
