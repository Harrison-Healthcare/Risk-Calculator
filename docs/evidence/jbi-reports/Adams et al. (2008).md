### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All participants were recruited from a large, well-defined AARP cohort aged 50–71 years across multiple U.S. regions.

**Exposures measured similarly for groups (2/2):** BMI, weight history, and body size measures were assessed via structured questionnaires and categorized consistently across analyses.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Self-reported anthropometrics validated in literature, with BMI calculated from consistent height and weight metrics.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age, smoking, physical activity, protein intake, diabetes, and hypertension were identified and incorporated into analysis models.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** Multivariate Cox regression used with stepwise inclusion of relevant covariates; stratified analyses performed.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Participants with prior kidney cancer diagnoses were excluded from baseline cohort.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** RCC cases were confirmed through cancer registry linkages with ICD-O codes.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was over 8 years with substantial case accrual (1,366 incident RCC cases).

**Follow-up complete, or differences described (2/2):** Follow-up was near-complete through state cancer registries, censoring for migration, death, or end of study.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up utilized (2/2):** Loss to follow-up procedures were clearly documented and handled through standard censoring rules.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Age-adjusted and multivariate Cox models with stratified and interaction analyses; tests of linear trend and interaction applied.
