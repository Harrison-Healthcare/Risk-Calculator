### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similarity of groups (2/2):** Cohort drawn from a single general-population source, stratified by age and gender; 99% Danish descent (no major selection biases).

**Exposure measured similarly (2/2):** ApoB (exposure) measured uniformly on fresh plasma samples for all participants at baseline.

**Validity/reliability of exposure (2/2):** Turbidimetric and colorimetric assays used; standardized, non-standardized methods described; high laboratory reliability.

**Confounders identified (2/2):** Key confounders (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking) explicitly identified.

**Strategies for confounding (2/2):** Multifactorial adjustment in Cox models; stratification by age-group tertiles; comparison of adjusted vs unadjusted results.

**Outcome-free at baseline (2/2):** All 9,231 participants were free of ischemic cardiovascular disease at study entry.

**Valid/reliable outcome measurement (2/2):** Endpoints (IHD, MI, ICVD, stroke) validated via hospital discharge register, death registry, clinical records, and neuroimaging criteria.

**Sufficient follow-up time (2/2):** Mean 8 years (63,059 person-years), adequate for cardiovascular endpoints.

**Complete follow-up and handling losses (2/2):** 100% follow-up via national registries; no losses.

**Addressing incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Not applicable—no losses to follow-up.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Age-adjusted Kaplan-Meier, multivariable Cox regression (with age as timescale and covariate), Poisson models, ROC-AUC comparisons; all methods well justified.

| Benn et al. (2007)   | JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cohort Studies | 20/22       | 91%                  | Large, well-characterized Danish cohort with comprehensive outcome ascertainment; complete follow-up (100% via national registries); Item 4 – single baseline measurement of lipid-lowering therapy limits assessment of exposure changes over time. |
