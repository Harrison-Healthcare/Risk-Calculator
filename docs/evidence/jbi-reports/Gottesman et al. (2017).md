### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** 15,744 black and white adults aged 44–66 were recruited from four U.S. communities under consistent ARIC protocols.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking) were assessed using standardized definitions and procedures at baseline (visit 1) for all participants.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Obesity, diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol were measured using clinical assessments; APOE ε4 genotype was determined through validated genotyping.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Key covariates such as age, sex, race, education, APOE ε4, and comorbid conditions were all identified and adjusted for.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models included all relevant covariates; race, APOE genotype, and age were tested for interactions; competing risk models were also used.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Dementia-free status at baseline was confirmed through exclusion and later verified via ARIC-NCS adjudication and surveillance data.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Dementia was diagnosed using a multi-tiered approach (adjudication, informant interviews, hospitalization codes), including formal neuropsychological batteries.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Follow-up extended over 25 years (1987–2013), sufficient to capture incident dementia.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Attrition due to death or nonattendance was described; dementia cases identified via multiple overlapping sources minimized bias.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Informant interviews, death certificates, and ICD-9 codes were used to identify dementia cases missed by in-person visits; sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox models, stratified and interaction analyses, competing risk models, and log-log link regressions were used to confirm associations and check assumptions.
