# Freedman et al. (2011)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similarity of groups (2/2):** Participants were all from the NIH-AARP cohort aged 50–71, recruited from the same general population across multiple U.S. states.

**Exposure measurement similarity (2/2):** Exposure (smoking status) was assessed uniformly at baseline using a standard questionnaire.

**Exposure validity and reliability (2/2):** Tobacco exposure measurement had high reproducibility and validity in prior studies (r=0.94 reproducibility; r=0.90–0.92 validity).

**Confounders identified (2/2):** Adjustments were made for key confounders including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and other lifestyle factors.

**Confounding strategies stated (2/2):** Multivariable Cox regression models accounted for a wide range of confounders.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Incident bladder cancer cases were identified prospectively; no cases included at baseline.

**Outcome measurement validity and reliability (2/2):** Cancer diagnoses confirmed via linkage to state cancer registries, validated to identify ~90% of cancers.

**Sufficient follow-up time (2/2):** Median follow-up was 11 years, sufficient for cancer outcomes.

**Follow-up completeness and reasons (1/2):** While follow-up was largely complete, loss to follow-up and related strategies were not thoroughly discussed.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No detailed strategies to manage incomplete follow-up provided.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Used hazard ratios, NNH, and population attributable risk estimates with appropriate models and subgroup analyses.
