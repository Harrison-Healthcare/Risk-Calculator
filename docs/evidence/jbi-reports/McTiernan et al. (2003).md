# McTiernan et al. (2003)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants were all postmenopausal women aged 50–79 from WHI-OS, ensuring population homogeneity and comparability.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Standardized self-reported physical activity questionnaires administered at baseline using structured protocols.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** MET-hours/week computed using validated methods and reproducibility testing showed good reliability (ICC = 0.77).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Considered BMI, hormone therapy, reproductive history, family history, lifestyle factors, and more.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Adjusted Cox models used with extensive covariates; subgroup analyses conducted by BMI tertiles, hormone therapy use, etc..

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Women with prior breast cancer excluded from analysis.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Cancer outcomes verified using SEER-based coding by blinded clinicians.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up 4.7 years, with over 347,000 woman-years; 1780 breast cancer cases captured.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** <3.2% lost to follow-up or withdrew; overall follow-up rates consistently >94%.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No detailed discussion of handling missing data or sensitivity analyses for attrition.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards regression with stratification and interaction testing; trend and subgroup tests performed.
