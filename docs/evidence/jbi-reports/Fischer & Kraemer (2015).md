# Fischer & Kraemer (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly defined objective to quantify SHS exposure risks for IHD, COPD, and stroke.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included case-control and cohort studies reporting effect sizes for SHS exposure and any of the three outcomes.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Search performed in PubMed following PRISMA guidelines; English/German-language human studies from 1984–2014.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Manual reference searches conducted in addition to database query; final inclusion of 24 studies after screening and quality filtering.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Used a customized 12-point scale based on PRISMA, MOOSE, and other tools for observational studies.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Dual author involvement in quality scoring and study exclusion decisions based on predefined thresholds.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Data extracted systematically with standardized forms; ORs converted to RRs using a conservative approach.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Inverse variance-weighted random-effects models applied using MIX 2.0 Pro with sex-specific and pooled subgroup analysis.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and heterogeneity statistics (Q, I²) used to evaluate publication and study bias; bias considered minimal.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** SHS associated with increased risk: IHD (RR = 1.27), COPD (RR = 1.66), stroke (RR = 1.35); stronger effects seen in women for all outcomes.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Advocated for larger prospective studies, use of biomarkers, and more focus on COPD and gender differences.
