### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** The cohort was drawn from the UK Biobank’s population-based sample of adults aged 37–73 years across the UK, excluding anyone with baseline dementia.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** All participants completed the same self-reported assessments for sleep, physical activity (IPAQ), and sedentary behavior, with uniform data processing protocols.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Validated instruments and MET-based categorization from IPAQ were used for PA, while sleep and SB categories were based on reproducible, standardized self-report methods.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Detailed list of covariates including age, sex, education, APOE ε4 status, BMI, income, depression, smoking, alcohol use, and physical impairment.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Four sequential Cox models and multiple sensitivity analyses included progressively richer covariate sets and mutual adjustments for all exposures.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** All cases of dementia were incident, excluding any participants with baseline dementia as confirmed by linked health records.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident dementia diagnoses were drawn from national hospital, death, and primary care records using ICD and Read codes.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was 9.0 years; robust enough to capture 5,390 dementia events and support longitudinal inference.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Loss to follow-up was minimal (7.5%), clearly quantified, and analyzed for bias; missing data handled with imputation and sensitivity checks.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Multiple imputation was conducted for missing covariates, and models excluding short follow-up cases helped rule out reverse causation.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models, restricted cubic splines, subgroup/interaction analyses, mediation models, and imaging correlations were all appropriately used and clearly reported.
