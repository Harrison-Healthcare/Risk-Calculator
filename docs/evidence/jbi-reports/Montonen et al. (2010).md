# Montonen et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were drawn from the same EPIC-Potsdam population using a random subcohort design with clearly defined inclusion criteria.

**Exposures measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** Biomarkers such as adiponectin, GGT, HDL-C, and hs-CRP were measured uniformly using standardized assays in all participants.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Used validated laboratory methods (e.g., ELISA, immunoassay, HPLC), with quality control and sex-specific quintile distributions applied.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, education, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, and diet were recognized as potential confounders.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Cox regression models with multivariate adjustments were used, along with mediation analyses to isolate the contributions of individual biomarkers.

**Participants free of outcome at study start (2/2):** Individuals with known diabetes at baseline or elevated baseline glucose were excluded to ensure incident case capture.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident type 2 diabetes was verified through physician-confirmed self-report, medication history, or dietary therapy (ICD-10 E11).

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up was 7 years, with diabetes cases confirmed through 4 follow-up rounds (â‰¥90% response rate).

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Attrition and exclusions were clearly documented, including missing biomarker values and implausible glucose readings.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Case-cohort methodology with Prentice-weighted Cox regression and exclusion criteria ensured high analytic validity.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Used advanced Cox modeling, effect decomposition, and sensitivity analyses (e.g., excluding early cases, adjusting for HbA1c) to explore biomarker contributions.

| Montonen et al. (2010) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 22/22 | 100% | Excellent case-cohort study within EPIC-Potsdam (n=613 cases, 2021 controls) assessing biomarker pathways (e.g., adiponectin, HDL-C, GGT, hs-CRP) and T2DM risk. Valid measures, detailed follow-up, and advanced decomposition analysis fully meet JBI criteria. |
