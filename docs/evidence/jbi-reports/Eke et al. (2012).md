# Eke et al. (2012)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** Used NHANES 2009–2010, a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** Participants selected via multistage random sampling, including oversampling of minorities.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** Final analytic sample included 3,743 dentate adults aged ≥30, weighted to represent 137 million U.S. adults.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Sociodemographic characteristics, dentition status, and exclusion criteria (edentulism, medical contraindications) were clearly reported.

**Sufficient coverage of sample in analysis (2/2):** Full-mouth periodontal exams (FMPE) conducted by calibrated dental hygienists in mobile centers with high completion rate.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (2/2):** Used CDC-AAP case definitions for mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis based on attachment loss (AL) and pocket depth (PD) at interproximal sites.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** AL and PD measured at 6 sites per tooth with standardized probes and trained examiners; prior validity confirmed in earlier studies.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Estimates weighted using MEC weights and analyzed using SUDAAN to account for complex survey design; prevalence stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, SES, and smoking.

**Adequate response rate (2/2):** Among eligible adults, >85% completed periodontal exams. Nonresponse bias adjusted through NHANES weighting protocols.

| Eke et al. (2012) | JBI Checklist for Prevalence Studies | 18/18 | 100% | NHANES 2009–2010 national survey with full-mouth periodontal exam in adults ≥30 years. Demonstrated 47.2% periodontitis prevalence (~64.7 million people), with disparities by age, sex, ethnicity, SES, and smoking. All appraisal criteria fully met. |
