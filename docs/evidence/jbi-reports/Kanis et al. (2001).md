### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** All data derived from the Swedish population and used national mortality and fracture incidence data from Malmö.

**Exposures measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** BMD exposure (T-scores) standardized using NHANES III reference values for all analyses.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) used at femoral neck with WHO-recommended diagnostic cutoffs.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age and sex identified as primary confounders; impact clearly stratified across multiple fracture types.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors (2/2):** Stratified modeling by age and sex, with gradients of risk derived from meta-analysis and age-specific incidence data.

**Participants free of the outcome at the start of the study (2/2):** Only first fractures were modeled, explicitly excluding repeat events.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Fracture data derived from validated Swedish national registers; BMD cutoffs aligned with WHO criteria.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** 10-year probabilities calculated; long-term data from Swedish cohorts used for fracture and mortality rates.

**Follow-up complete and reasons for loss described (2/2):** Entire population modeled using national registries; loss to follow-up not applicable in this context.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (1/2):** While adjusted for mortality, there was no mention of how missing data or migration were handled.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Poisson regression, meta-analytic gradients of risk, and stratified probability estimates across BMD and age levels.
