# Walldius et al. (2021)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All participants from a large Swedish occupational and outpatient screening population without prior cardiovascular events.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** ApoB and apoA-1 levels obtained from the same lab using WHO-standardized assays across all participants.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Apolipoproteins measured using immunoturbidimetry with <5% CV; results reproducible and validated.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Included age, sex, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, SES; sensitivity analyses added hypertension, smoking, and diabetes.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Cox regression with multivariable adjustment; sensitivity analyses confirmed results across subgroups.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Excluded all with prior MI, stroke, cardiovascular death, or interventions (CABG/PCI).

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** MACE events determined using national registers with ICD coding; validated linkage systems.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up of 17.8 years; >22,000 MACE events observed.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Virtually no loss to follow-up reported due to registry linkage; national mortality and hospitalization records used.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Lacked specific strategies to manage missing data or medication use; some events likely influenced by treatment changes not accounted for.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox models, Kaplan–Meier, ROC-AUC, and nested case-control trajectory models used; robust and well-validated approach.

| Walldius et al. (2021) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | Swedish AMORIS cohort (n = 137,100) with 17.8 years average follow-up. ApoB/apoA-1 ratio independently predicted MACE and its components up to 20 years in advance. Biomarker trajectories and subgroup analyses are major strengths. Item 10 – incomplete discussion on loss to follow-up or medication use over time. |
