# Mills et al. (2004)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups comparable other than disease presence (2/2):** Controls were frequency-matched to cases by age, sex, race, and region from the same population base.

**Cases and controls matched appropriately (2/2):** Matching was done using California Cancer Registry and random digit dialing with structured criteria.

**Same criteria used for identification (2/2):** All cases were histologically confirmed; controls were randomly selected healthy individuals.

**Exposure measured in standard, valid and reliable way (2/2):** FFQ adapted from validated instruments; interviewers trained and consistent procedures followed.

**Exposure measured the same way for cases and controls (2/2):** Both groups interviewed via telephone with the same questionnaire and protocols.

**Confounding factors identified (1/2):** Identification of oral contraceptive use as a confound, but no other mentions in the methods or analysis sections.

**Strategies to deal with confounders stated (0/2):** No mention of adjusting for potential dietary or lifestyle confounders in logistic models.

**Outcomes assessed in standard, valid and reliable way (2/2):** Osteosarcoma cases identified through registry with histologic verification.

**Exposure period long enough to be meaningful (1/2):** Dietary data reflect general prior habits, but the reference period or latency between exposure and outcome is not detailed.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Conditional logistic regression used; ORs with 95% CI presented and interpreted correctly.

| Mills et al. (2004) | JBI Checklist for Case Control Studies | 16/20 | 80.0% | Population-based case-control study on diet and osteosarcoma risk using registry and telephone data; strengths include matched controls, standardized diet assessment; Item 6 – only one confounder identified; Item 7 – no strategies to address confounding discussed; Item 9 – exposure window unclear. |
