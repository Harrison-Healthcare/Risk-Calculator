### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

Checklist Used: JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Yes. Participants were all from NOMAS, a well-characterized, multiethnic urban cohort, selected using consistent eligibility criteria.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Yes. Adiponectin and all vascular risk factors were measured at baseline under uniform protocols using validated laboratory assays and standardized questionnaires.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Yes. Adiponectin was assessed using a validated ELISA with excellent intra- and inter-assay precision; exposures like diabetes and lipid profiles were collected using clinical definitions.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Yes. Authors controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, lifestyle behaviors, metabolic factors, and inflammatory markers in multiple models.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Yes. Multivariable linear regression and stratified subgroup analyses were used to adjust and examine interactions across covariates and race/ethnicity.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Yes. This analysis was cross-sectional in its measurement but nested within a longitudinal cohort where only baseline values were used—no pre-existing stroke or MI history was included.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Yes. Cardiovascular risk markers (e.g., HDL-C, LDL-C, HOMA-IR, CRP) were measured using validated assays; metabolic syndrome was defined per NCEP ATP III guidelines.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Yes. Although this analysis focused on baseline cross-sectional data, it was embedded in an ongoing longitudinal cohort designed for follow-up on clinical endpoints.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Yes. Sample exclusions were clearly described (e.g., prior MI), and 2900 participants were analyzed from a larger enrolled cohort with comparable characteristics.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Yes. Robust baseline comparisons and exclusions were implemented to ensure representativeness; missing biomarker data were analyzed in subsets with transparency.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Yes. Used multivariable linear regressions with log-transformed adiponectin, interaction terms, and R² values; results stratified by race, BMI, and waist circumference.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gardener et al. (2013) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 22/22 | 100% | Well-conducted cohort analysis within the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) assessing adiponectin and vascular risk by race/ethnicity. Uniform exposure/outcome measurement, robust statistical adjustment, and stratified analyses across subgroups fully meet all checklist criteria. |
