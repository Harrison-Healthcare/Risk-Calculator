### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Defined objective to assess whether depression increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI) .

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Only population-based prospective cohort studies with baseline CHD-free participants and reported RR/HR for CHD or MI were included .

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to April 2014 using broad MeSH and keyword combinations .

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Databases supplemented with manual searches of references; 30 studies (40 reports) included after full-text screening .

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Newcastle-Ottawa Scale applied independently by two reviewers to assess cohort validity; average score = 7.8.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Independent data extraction and quality scoring by dual reviewers with κ = 0.959 agreement.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized forms and consensus resolution used for data extraction, with pooled estimates adjusted for confounding factors.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects models with I² and Q tests for heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses, and subgroup stratification applied.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots, Begg and Egger tests performed; trim-and-fill correction used, adjusting RR from 1.30 to 1.25 with no major change.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Depression associated with 30% increased risk of CHD (RR=1.30) and MI (RR=1.30); adjusted for major lifestyle and clinical confounders .

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Suggested standardized repeated measures of depression and interventional trials to clarify causality and dose-response.

| Gan et al. (2014) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Meta-analysis of 30 prospective cohort studies (n=893,850) examining depression and risk of CHD/MI. Demonstrated consistent, significant associations with subgroup and sensitivity analyses, heterogeneity exploration, and publication bias correction. All JBI criteria fully met. |
