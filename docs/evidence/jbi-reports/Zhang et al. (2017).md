# Zhang et al. (2017)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** Assessed COPD and lung cancer risk in prospective studies.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Required prospective design, smoking adjustment, and risk estimates with CIs.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Used MEDLINE and EMBASE with keyword and MeSH terms up to December 2016.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** Major databases plus manual reference search ensured comprehensive coverage.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (0/2):** No formal critical appraisal tool (e.g., NOS) applied.

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (1/2):** Independent review and consensus for study selection and data extraction noted, but not explicitly for quality assessment.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Extracted most-adjusted RRs/HRs using a structured process with third-party adjudication.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Used DerSimonian–Laird random-effects model; I² and meta-regression applied.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Egger’s/Begg’s tests, funnel plots, and trim-and-fill adjustment used.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Stratified analysis by gender, smoking status, histology, and severity validated conclusions.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Recommended mechanistic studies, histology-focused analyses, and medication adjustment.
