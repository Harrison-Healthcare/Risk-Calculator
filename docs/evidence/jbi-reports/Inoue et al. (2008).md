# Inoue et al. (2008)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were drawn from the same health check-up program (Yuport Medical Center), all diabetes-free at baseline, and followed longitudinally .

**Exposures measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c were measured uniformly using validated lab protocols for all participants during the same period.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** FPG was assessed using the hexokinase-G6PD method, and HbA1c by latex immuno-agglutination (aligned to JDS/NGSP), both with low inter-assay variability (CV ≤ 3%).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Identified and adjusted for BMI, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, liver enzymes (ALT), and white blood cell count in multivariate models .

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and biomarkers were used; results were stratified by FPG and HbA1c categories .

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Subjects with diabetes at baseline (self-reported or FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L) were excluded, ensuring incident case detection.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Diabetes incidence was defined by FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or physician diagnosis at follow-up; both definitions aligned with ADA/JDS criteria.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up was 5.5 years (range: 2.0–8.0), with 55,844 person-years accrued, sufficient to detect new diabetes cases.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Non-follow-up characteristics were compared to participants; differences were minor, and exclusions were transparently reported.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Participants with less than 2 years between baseline and follow-up were excluded; analyses accounted for potential selection bias.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Used age/sex-adjusted and multivariable Cox models, subgroup analyses, and hazard ratios stratified by FPG/HbA1c (Table 2, p. 1160).
