**Were objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition? (2/2):** Yes. The study assessed sleep behaviors against the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, providing a standardized framework for evaluation.

**Were confounding factors identified? (2/2):** Yes. The study considered various potential confounders, including age, sex, household education, household income adequacy, and employment status.

**Were strategies to deal with confounding factors stated? (2/2):** Yes. The study stratified analyses by sociodemographic characteristics to address potential confounding.

**Were the outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** Yes. Outcomes such as sleep duration, quality, and variability were measured using validated self-report questions within the CCHS framework.

**Was appropriate statistical analysis used? (2/2):** Yes. The study employed descriptive statistics and stratified analyses to examine sleep behaviors across different sociodemographic groups, which are appropriate for the study design and objectives.
