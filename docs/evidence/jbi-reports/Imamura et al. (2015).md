# Imamura et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The review investigates associations between sugar-sweetened, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice with type 2 diabetes and estimates population attributable fractions.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Eligibility required prospective studies in adults without diabetes, evaluating beverage consumption and incident diabetes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Thorough search conducted using PubMed, Embase, Ovid, and Web of Knowledge, aligned with PRISMA.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Extensive use of multiple databases, supplemented by author contact and hand searches.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No structured criteria or tools described for critical appraisal of included studies.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers (1/2):** Duplicate review process noted, but specific critical appraisal methodology not detailed.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Data extraction performed using standardized procedures in duplicate with resolution of discrepancies by consensus.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Employed random-effects models and conducted meta-regression and sensitivity analyses to account for heterogeneity.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Assessed using funnel plots and Egger’s regression, particularly for artificially sweetened beverages.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Policy implications and conclusions were supported by meta-analytic findings and carefully framed under causal assumptions.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Identified needs for causal studies and better differentiation of beverage types for future work.
