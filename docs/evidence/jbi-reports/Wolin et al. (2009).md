### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim was to quantify the association between physical activity and colon cancer, separating it from colorectal cancer estimates.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included case-control and cohort studies with colon cancer as a distinct endpoint and quantifiable physical activity measures.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Searched PubMed through June 2008 using defined terms; reference lists and prior reviews were also searched.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Studies from various countries and multiple publication years included; both case-control and cohort designs analyzed.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Seven-point quality score based on exposure validation, adjustment for confounders, and follow-up/response rate rigor.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Single primary reviewer extracted data with standard criteria and validated by co-authors using established scoring.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Data abstracted for exposure, outcome, adjustment, and quality; analysis used standardized weighting formulas.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Used random-effects models; subgroup analysis by sex, study design, publication year, and activity domain; quality score–weighted estimates included.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Begg's test showed no evidence of significant bias (p = 0.45).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Overall 24% reduced risk of colon cancer with high vs low activity (RR = 0.76); consistent for men and women and across domains.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Calls for dose-response data, exploration of activity type/intensity, and stratification by tumor site, sex, and race/ethnicity.
