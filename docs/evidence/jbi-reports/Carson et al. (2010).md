# Carson et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All participants were from NHANES III, a national U.S. probability sample; all were free of diabetes at baseline.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** HbA1c was measured at baseline using standardized, high-quality laboratory procedures with quality control systems.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** HbA1c measured via high-performance liquid chromatography with alternate methods used for hemoglobin variants; CVs reported for assay reproducibility.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Identified and adjusted for variables including demographics, lifestyle, CVD history, metabolic/liver/red cell indices.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multiple regression models adjusted for 7 categories of variables, including socioeconomic, clinical, and biological factors.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** All participants were free from diabetes and had no prior CVD event data included in the sensitivity analysis models.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** All-cause mortality obtained via linkage to the National Death Index, validated with >95% sensitivity and specificity.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was 8.8 years (up to 12 years); 1,825 deaths were recorded.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Minimal loss; only 19 participants excluded for missing follow-up, ensuring a nearly complete cohort.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Although exclusion criteria were well defined, the study did not explicitly discuss methods for imputing or addressing missing exposure/outcome data.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models with multivariable adjustment and spline modeling; sensitivity analyses excluding individuals with cancer, CVD, anemia, hepatitis C.

| Carson et al. (2010) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | NHANES III cohort (n = 14,099) with 8.8 years median follow-up linked to mortality data. Found increased all-cause mortality at both high and low HbA1c levels among non-diabetics. Item 10 â€“ no specific strategy for handling potential follow-up losses or missing biomarker data. |
