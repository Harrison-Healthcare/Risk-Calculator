# Barber et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similar groups recruited (2/2):** All participants were men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), with uniform eligibility criteria and exclusions applied prospectively.

**Exposures measured similarly (2/2):** Family history was collected via structured questionnaire in 1996, consistently applied across the cohort.

**Exposure measurement valid/reliable (2/2):** Family history reporting is a standard, self-reported exposure in cohort studies; the questionnaire captured cancer site and relative type.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** The study clearly acknowledges and adjusts for age, race, BMI, smoking, PSA screening, and other lifestyle factors.

**Strategies for confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox models were used with comprehensive covariate adjustment.

**Participants free of outcome at baseline (2/2):** Men with prior cancers (except non-melanoma skin cancer) were excluded, ensuring they were free of the outcome initially.

**Valid/reliable outcome measurement (2/2):** Prostate cancer cases were confirmed via medical records and pathology reports.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Follow-up spanned 16 years, which is ample for observing prostate cancer development.

**Complete follow-up (1/2):** Follow-up completeness is not explicitly stated; cohort retention and dropout details are lacking.

**Addressed loss to follow-up (1/2):** No strategies for handling loss to follow-up or attrition bias are mentioned.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models and competing risk methods were correctly applied with sensitivity analyses.
