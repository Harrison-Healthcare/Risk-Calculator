# Camargo et al. (2011)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clearly investigates the link between occupational asbestos exposure and ovarian cancer.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included only cohort studies with asbestos exposure and reported SMRs or SIRs for ovarian cancer.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive PubMed search with additional references from previous reviews.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** 18 studies (20 cohorts) from diverse industrial settings and global locations.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal critical appraisal criteria (e.g., NOS) applied to evaluate study quality.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Two reviewers conducted screening and data extraction, but appraisal was not independently or formally conducted.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Dual extraction with third-party resolution process used.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects model, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression applied appropriately.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Egger’s test and funnel plots conducted; no publication bias identified (Figure 4).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** SMRs supported causal interpretation consistent with IARC classification.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Recommended future studies with exposure quantification and pathological confirmation.
