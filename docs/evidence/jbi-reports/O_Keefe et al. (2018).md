# O_Keefe et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** Clearly aimed to compare sex-specific risks of lung cancer due to smoking using cohort data.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included only cohort studies reporting sex-specific RRs adjusted at least for age.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive searches of PubMed and EMBASE with explicit dates and supplemented by prior reviews.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** Two major databases and additional IPD sources (APCSC, NHANES III, SHHEC) ensured coverage.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (2/2):** Used Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS); detailed in supplementary material with study-level scores reported (Table 1).

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (2/2):** Dual independent review and adjudication described (LMOK and GT with SAEP arbitration).

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Extracted population characteristics, sex-specific risk estimates, and covariates using standard forms.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analyses used for sex-specific comparisons; heterogeneity tested with I² and meta-regression.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Funnel plots and Begg’s tests conducted; no evidence of publication bias found.

**Recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Interpretations align with data, but effects of study quality and potential bias (e.g., self-reporting misclassification) are discussed only briefly and not quantitatively integrated into the synthesis.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Identifies sex-specific exposure misclassification and histologic subtype analysis as future priorities.

| O’Keeffe et al. (2018) | JBI Systematic Reviews Checklist | 21/22 | 95.5% | High-quality sex-specific meta-analysis of smoking and lung cancer using 99 cohorts and >50,000 cases. NOS used for quality appraisal, but impact of risk of bias not clearly integrated into interpretation (Item 10 = 1). |
