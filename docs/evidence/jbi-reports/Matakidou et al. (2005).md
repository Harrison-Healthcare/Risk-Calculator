# Matakidou et al. (2005)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The aim was to evaluate familial lung cancer risk through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included studies that stratified lung cancer risk by family history; 28 case-control, 17 cohort, 7 twin studies.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Used PubMed search from 1963 to 2005 with manual checking of references.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Broad inclusion of both case-control and cohort studies across global settings.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No methodological quality appraisal of included studies was reported.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** No indication that independent or duplicate appraisal was performed.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Adjusted estimates prioritized; meta-regression conducted to explore heterogeneity.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects models and I² statistics used; separate pooled estimates for subgroups.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s tests applied; publication year examined as a source of bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Findings on dose–response by number of affected relatives and age of onset clearly interpreted.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Calls for molecular confirmation of genetic susceptibility loci and improved adjustment for smoking.

| Matakidou et al. (2005) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Strong meta-analysis of 52 studies on familial lung cancer risk with subgroup, never-smoker, and twin analyses; Item 5 – no critical appraisal of included studies; Item 6 – unclear if appraisal was independently conducted. |
