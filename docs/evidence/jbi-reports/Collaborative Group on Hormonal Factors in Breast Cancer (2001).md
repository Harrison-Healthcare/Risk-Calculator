# Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer (2001)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim to assess how breast cancer risk varies by number and age of affected first-degree relatives is clearly articulated in abstract and introduction.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included studies had â‰¥100 incident breast cancer cases and data on first-degree relative history, with broad geographical coverage.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Collaborators identified >80% of eligible studies worldwide; prior methods described for study identification and inclusion.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Included both published and 2 unpublished studies; international representation across 52 datasets.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Only studies with incident breast cancer cases and standardized exposure variables were included.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Central checking of individual-level data with follow-up queries to original investigators for data validation.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Uniform definitions and central harmonization; stratified regression modeling reduced potential misclassification.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Conditional logistic regression stratified by multiple factors, use of floating absolute risks (FARs), and detailed subgroup analyses.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Limited concern due to direct acquisition of individual data from both published and unpublished sources; similarity of results across study designs supports validity.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Provided quantitative absolute and relative risk estimates by age and number of affected relatives, with clear implications for public health and counseling.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Highlights need to improve age-at-diagnosis data for relatives, expand assessments of multigenerational history, and link to genetic markers.
