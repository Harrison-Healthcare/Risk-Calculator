# Feigelson et al. (2001)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All participants were women in CPS-II, enrolled nationally using consistent procedures.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Alcohol use assessed via self-report using standardized questions at baseline for all participants.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Though self-reported, prior validation and a 10-year follow-up questionnaire support reliability of alcohol intake measurement.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Multiple known breast cancer risk factors listed and addressed in analyses (e.g., age, BMI, ERT, family history).

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Adjusted Cox models used, with extensive covariates; subgroup and interaction analyses conducted.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Women with prior breast cancer excluded at baseline.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Mortality data from National Death Index and state certificates, using ICD-9 coding for breast cancer death.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up of 14 years, long enough for breast cancer outcomes to occur.

**Loss to follow-up described (1/2):** Some mention of women lost to follow-up (2%), but no detailed attrition description or handling strategies.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Minimal discussion on missing data handling, exclusions made but no imputation or sensitivity analysis reported.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models stratified by menopausal status and adjusted for relevant confounders.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feigelson et al. (2001) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 19/22 | 86.4% | Large, well-described cohort with long follow-up and clear exposure/outcome measurement. Item 7 – strategies to address confounding described, but some residual confounding possible; Item 9 – loss to follow-up not quantified; Item 10 – no explicit strategies for handling missing follow-up data. |
