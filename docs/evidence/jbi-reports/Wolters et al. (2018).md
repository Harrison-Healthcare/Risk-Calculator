# Wolters et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Clearly investigates whether coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) increase risk of dementia.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Included prospective cohorts reporting incident dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in individuals with CHD or HF.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Extensive database search (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane) with no language restrictions; search strategy documented in Appendix A.1.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Multiple databases and manual reference checks; authors contacted for missing data.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Applied a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tailored for observational studies; full scoring reported in Table 2.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Two reviewers (F.J.W. and R.A.S.) independently appraised all included studies.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Independent dual extraction with a standardized protocol, discrepancies resolved by consensus.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Inverse-variance weighted random-effects models used; appropriate for heterogeneous cohort data.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s tests performed separately for CHD and HF; sensitivity analysis stratified by study design.

**Were the recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Conclude CHD and HF increase dementia risk; recommend multidisciplinary care and preventive attention in cardiology practice.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Call for more diverse and mechanistically informative studies; emphasize the need for integrated cardiac and cognitive assessments.
