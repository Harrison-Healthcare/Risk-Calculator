# Fabiani et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Assessed the epidemiological association between chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC) infection and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) .

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included epidemiological studies with at least one internal age/gender-matched control group and sufficient data to calculate OR or RR .

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Conducted a comprehensive PubMed search up to February 29, 2016, using detailed search terms across diabetes and hepatitis concepts .

**Sources/resources used to search studies adequate (2/2):** Used a single major database (PubMed), but supplemented by broad search terms and screening 544 records. Adequate for the scope of the study .

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** Inclusion/exclusion criteria and stratification by disease severity and control type ensured comparability; explicit criteria used to exclude low-quality or confounded studies.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Two reviewers independently assessed studies; discrepancies were resolved by a third author through discussion .

**Methods to minimize data extraction error (2/2):** Data extraction was conducted independently and cross-verified. Data included sample size, disease definitions, and outcome .

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used random-effects meta-analyses with forest plots stratified by liver disease stage and control type. Heterogeneity assessed with I² and Egger’s test performed for bias.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Publication bias assessed using Egger’s test; findings and heterogeneity values reported by subgroup.

**Recommendations for policy/practice supported by data (2/2):** Recommended integrating T2DM screening into HCV care pathways and vice versa, based on clear risk associations.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Called for longitudinal real-world studies and evaluation of HCV eradication therapies on long-term diabetes outcomes.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fabiani et al. (2018) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 19/22 | 86.5% | Strong meta-analysis of 33 studies examining HCV and T2DM risk. PRISMA-compliant, dual screening, stratified and dose–response synthesis with heterogeneity and publication bias assessment. No formal study appraisal tool applied (Item 5 = 0), and dual-reviewer procedures only partially described (Item 6 = 1). |
