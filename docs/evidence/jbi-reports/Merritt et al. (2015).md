# Merritt et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Recruited women aged 25–70 across 10 European countries, using standardized procedures.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Reproductive exposures self-reported at baseline via structured questionnaires; same instruments used across sites.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Variables like parity, age at menarche, breastfeeding, OC use, etc., were standard and plausibly accurate despite being retrospective self-reports.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Authors adjusted for BMI, physical activity, education, smoking status/intensity/duration, and menopausal status.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariate Cox regression and interaction/sensitivity analyses addressed key confounders thoroughly.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Women with baseline cancer, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes were excluded to reduce reverse causality.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Cause-specific mortality derived from national registries or validated active follow-up protocols.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up of 12.9 years, during which over 14,000 deaths occurred, is sufficient for mortality outcomes.

**Loss to follow-up described (1/2):** Study states 99% follow-up for vital status, but missing data imputation or attrition analyses are not detailed.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No description of strategies such as imputation, weighting, or multiple modeling approaches for missing data.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression with stratification by center and age, plus trend tests and interactions, implemented appropriately.
