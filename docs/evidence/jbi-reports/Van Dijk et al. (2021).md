### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Were the criteria for inclusion in the sample clearly defined? (2/2):** Yes. Inclusion required data on both family depression history and baseline KSADS psychiatric diagnoses; exclusions (e.g., missing data) were reported in detail .

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Yes. Children aged 9–11 were drawn from the national ABCD study, with site-level stratified random sampling from U.S. schools; demographic characteristics and SES are extensively reported (Table 1, p. 5) .

**Was the exposure measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** Yes. Family history of depression (G1 and G2) was reported by parents using a standardized, validated question consistent with psychiatric criteria .

**Were objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition? (2/2):** Yes. Psychiatric conditions were assessed using the web-based KSADS-5 diagnostic interview, with established reliability and concordance with clinician-based interviews .

**Were confounding factors identified? (2/2):** Yes. Analyses controlled for SES, sex, race/ethnicity, child age, parent age, marital status, and informant identity .

**Were strategies to deal with confounding factors stated? (2/2):** Yes. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to control for clustering and multiple covariates; moderation analyses examined interaction terms .

**Were the outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** Yes. Diagnoses were based on parent and child reports using KSADS-5, with composite variables defined for each psychiatric condition; discrepancies were explored in detail (κ statistics, Table S2, p. 19) .

**Was appropriate statistical analysis used? (2/2):** Yes. GEE with Poisson log-link, trend tests (Cochran-Armitage), and stratified models by SES, sex, and race were appropriately used and described (Tables 2–3, Figures 1–2) .
