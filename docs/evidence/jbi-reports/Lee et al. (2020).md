# Lee et al. (2020)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clearly aimed to assess the association between breast cancer and osteoporotic fractures.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Defined original articles with fracture outcomes, excluded treatment-confounded populations.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive database search (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane) with PRISMA adherence and detailed strategies provided.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Initial search returned 2,161 articles; 4 studies included based on stringent criteria and manual reference checks.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No mention of critical appraisal or study quality assessment tools applied to included studies.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Screening and selection conducted independently by two reviewers, but no critical appraisal was conducted.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Dual reviewer data extraction using predefined spreadsheets.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random- or fixed-effects models used based on heterogeneity; I² and Chi-square statistics applied.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** While not graphically reported, selection processes and small number of included studies reduce concern for bias; discussed in limitations.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clearly reported higher fracture risk in breast cancer patients; adjusted HRs and ORs presented by fracture type.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Authors call for larger, better-designed studies to explore mechanisms and confounding factors.
