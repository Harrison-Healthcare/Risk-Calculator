### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** The objective—to assess whether job strain is associated with major cardiovascular risk factors—is explicitly stated in the abstract and introduction.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included working adults from eight European cohort studies with harmonized exposure, outcome, and covariate definitions.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** While not a traditional systematic search, the IPD-Work Consortium used predefined inclusion of harmonizable, high-quality cohort datasets; eligibility criteria well documented.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** The meta-analysis includes high-quality prospective cohorts (e.g., Whitehall II, WOLF, HNR, Belstress) across multiple countries and settings.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Cohorts were selected based on prior validation, exposure harmonization, and availability of biomarker and survey data.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** All data were reanalyzed using common protocols and double-checking, minimizing reviewer bias.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Uniform data formatting, coding manuals, and pre-analysis harmonization of variables (job strain, biomarkers, Framingham score) ensured consistency.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Used mixed-effects models with study as a random effect and adjustments for sex, age, and SES.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Although formal publication bias testing (e.g., funnel plots) was not applicable, the use of unpublished IPD reduces such bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Job strain associated with higher odds of diabetes (OR = 1.29), smoking (OR = 1.14), inactivity (OR = 1.34), obesity (OR = 1.12), and Framingham risk (OR = 1.13).

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Authors suggest future studies explore inflammatory and ambulatory BP markers rather than resting BP/lipids, and examine bidirectional relationships.

| Nyberg et al. (2013) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Individual participant meta-analysis from 8 European cohorts (n = 47,045). Found job strain associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, smoking, obesity, inactivity, and Framingham risk—but not with BP or lipid profiles. High-quality IPD methodology with robust harmonization, adjustment, and bias control. All JBI criteria fully met. |
