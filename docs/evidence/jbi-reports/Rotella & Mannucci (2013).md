# Rotella & Mannucci (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Yes. The review aims to assess the risk of incident clinical depression or depressive symptoms in individuals with diabetes compared to those without.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Yes. Included longitudinal cohort or case-control studies comparing incident depression in diabetic vs. non-diabetic subjects.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched using the terms "diabetes AND (depression OR antidepressant)" with manual reference checks.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Yes. Major biomedical databases were searched and additional references scanned to ensure completeness.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Studies were evaluated for design, exposure/outcome definition, and confounder adjustment. Key variables such as diagnostic methods and follow-up descriptions were extracted and analyzed.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Yes. Both authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data, resolving disagreements through discussion.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Yes. Dual independent data extraction was conducted with cross-checks on study design, confounders, and outcome incidence.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Random-effects meta-analysis was used; heterogeneity (I² = 71.2%) justified this approach. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Yes. Funnel plots and Kendall’s tau were used for both odds ratios and hazard ratios; no significant publication bias was detected.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Yes. Authors concluded that diabetes increases risk for incident depression and recommended that clinicians monitor for depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Authors called for further studies to examine causal mechanisms, refine diagnostic criteria, and explore confounders like comorbidities and treatment burden.
