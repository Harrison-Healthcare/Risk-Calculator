# Ntritsos et al. (2022)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** Investigated gender-specific global COPD prevalence and its variation by age, geography, diagnostic method, and setting.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Population-based studies with gender-specific COPD prevalence data published from 2005 to 2015 were included based on predefined PICO criteria.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic search conducted in Medline and Embase with documented search terms and eligibility screening via Doctor Evidence software.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** Two major biomedical databases used, plus hand-checking of reference lists and inclusion of prior systematic reviews' studies.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (2/2):** Methodological quality checked during screening and data extraction, with quality control checks and predefined harmonization protocols.

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (2/2):** Primary screening and QC by separate reviewers, with discrepancies adjudicated by a third methodologist.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Predefined forms used for extracting patient-level and study-level covariates; ~10% pilot sample for process calibration.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis of double-arcsine transformed prevalence data with credible intervals.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Not explicitly discussed in traditional terms, but overlap in estimates across studies, sensitivity analyses, and meta-regressions address bias risk.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Data clearly support conclusions regarding gender differences and heterogeneity by setting, diagnosis, and age.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Authors highlight regional data gaps, need for standardized spirometry-based definitions, and sex-based physiological investigations.
