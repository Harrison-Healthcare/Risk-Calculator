# Permuth-Wey & Egan (2009)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly aims to quantify familial pancreatic cancer risk.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Accepted case-control and cohort studies with family history-based risk estimates.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** MEDLINE search 1966–2007 with family and cancer-related terms; supplemented by hand-searching.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Broad time span and literature types; included older studies not indexed in modern databases.

**Appraisal criteria appropriate (1/2):** Study quality indicators (e.g., exposure ascertainment, diagnostic confirmation) were reviewed but no scoring system applied.

**Independent critical appraisal (2/2):** Both authors reviewed and extracted data jointly, improving appraisal reliability.

**Minimized extraction errors (2/2):** Data items included study type, design, diagnostic method, and risk estimates; dual handling minimized error.

**Combination of studies appropriate (2/2):** Used DerSimonian–Laird random-effects meta-analysis and stratified subgroup analysis.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Begg–Mazumdar test (p = 0.089) and funnel plot showed no publication bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Findings support 2-fold increased risk and guide screening/counseling discussions.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Encourages further investigation into syndromic patterns and prospective familial risk estimation.
