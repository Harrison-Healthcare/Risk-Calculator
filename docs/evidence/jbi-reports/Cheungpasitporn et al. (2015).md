# Cheungpasitporn et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** Explicit aim to assess the association between kidney stones and kidney cancer (RCC and TCC).

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included observational studies reporting relative risk estimates comparing individuals with and without a history of kidney stones.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases, supplemented by manual search of references.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** Three major databases searched plus manual bibliography reviews; conference abstracts excluded.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (2/2):** Used the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale; scores for each included study provided in Table 1 on pages 3–4.

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (2/2):** Independent dual review for eligibility and quality, with consensus resolution described.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Standardized form used for extracting design, sample, effect estimates, and adjustments.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis using inverse-variance method; heterogeneity assessed with I² and Q-tests.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Funnel plots used; bias suspected for RCC (positive study favor) and TCC (negative study favor).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Findings stratified by cancer type and sex; conclusions supported by data synthesis (e.g., RCC risk in males only).

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Identified surveillance bias, confounding, and lack of causal clarity as future research areas.
