### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** Participants were employees from 12 worksites in Japan participating in the HIPOP-OHP trial, all initially free from diabetes.

**Exposures measured similarly (2/2):** Sleep quality and duration were assessed via the same standardized self-reported questionnaire across the cohort.

**Exposure measurement valid and reliable (2/2):** Construct validity of the sleep measures was confirmed using SF-36 quality of life domains and associations with sleep duration (see Figure 1, p. 6).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Considered BMI, age, gender, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, cholesterol, hypertension, and intervention status.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Multivariate Cox models were used, with incremental adjustment across three models (Tables 2, p. 5).

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Excluded participants with diabetes at baseline, based on medical history and glucose criteria.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Diabetes defined using ADA/WHO criteria (fasting glucose, random glucose, medication use, or self-report).

**Follow-up time reported and adequate (2/2):** Median follow-up was 4.2 years, long enough to observe incident diabetes.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** No significant loss to follow-up reported; all participants had annual follow-up through the workplace program.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up described (2/2):** Although loss was minimal, adjustments for study intervention status were made to mitigate confounding.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Used Cox proportional hazard models with appropriate covariate adjustments; trend tests applied.
