# Grontved & Hu (2011)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clearly aimed to quantify the association between TV viewing and type 2 diabetes, CVD, and mortality.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included prospective cohorts of initially healthy adults, reporting RR/OR for the specified outcomes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive database search (MEDLINE, EMBASE) with defined keywords and reference list checks.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Search covered 1970–2011 across two major databases, with no language restrictions initially stated.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal quality assessment tool (e.g., NOS) applied to evaluate study risk of bias.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers independently (1/2):** Data extraction was performed independently, but no mention of independent appraisal of study quality.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Dual extraction with consensus resolution, standardization of TV exposure across studies.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used random-effects meta-analysis, GLS trend estimation, and nonlinear dose-response modeling.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Egger’s test performed, no evidence of publication bias reported (p > 0.05).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Well-grounded conclusions.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Suggests need for more nuanced research on mechanisms, media types, and objective measures.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grøntved & Hu (2011) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Strong dose-response meta-analysis with consistent findings across outcomes. Item 5 – no formal critical appraisal tool applied to included studies; Item 6 – unclear if independent appraisal occurred. |
