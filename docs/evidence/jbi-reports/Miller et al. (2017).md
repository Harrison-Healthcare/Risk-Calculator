### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants were adults aged 35–70 years, free of cardiovascular disease, recruited from 613 communities in 18 countries across all income levels.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Country-specific, validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were used at baseline in all locations, developed using 24-hour recall comparisons.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** FFQs had validation correlation coefficients between 0.23–0.81 for fruit and vegetable intake, with quartile classification concordance rates >70%.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Models adjusted for age, sex, energy intake, smoking, diabetes, location, physical activity, education, income, and dietary co-variables.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox frailty models with random effects and subgroup analyses by geography, socioeconomic status, and health status were used.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Participants with prior cardiovascular disease were excluded from baseline.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Outcomes (CVD, death) were based on death certificates, medical records, and adjudicated using predefined criteria by trained physicians in each country.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was 7.4 years, with at least 3-year contacts and final events recorded through March 2017.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** 1230 participants were excluded for missing follow-up information, suggesting generally high follow-up completeness for 135,335 participants.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Although loss to follow-up was low, there was no detailed explanation of methods for imputing missing exposure or outcome data.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox frailty models with random intercepts, subgroup interaction terms, and sensitivity analyses (e.g., waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension) were applied.
