# Blum et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Focused on the association of subclinical thyroid dysfunction with hip and other fracture risks.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included prospective cohorts with baseline thyroid function data and incident fracture follow-up.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE with no language restrictions; supplemented by expert cohort solicitation.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** 13 international cohorts with 70,298 participants and over 760,000 person-years of follow-up.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Newcastle–Ottawa Scale used to evaluate each cohort’s quality (see eTable 2, referenced in the text).

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** While study selection was independently reviewed, appraisal independence for NOS not clearly reported.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** IPD analysis with central harmonization; discrepancies resolved with original investigators.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Two-step IPD meta-analysis using Cox models per cohort with pooled estimates from random-effects meta-analysis.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s test performed; sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Results show higher fracture risk for subclinical hyperthyroidism, particularly with suppressed TSH; consistent across models.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Emphasized need for RCTs to evaluate treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism and long-term outcomes.
