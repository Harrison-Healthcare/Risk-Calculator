### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups comparable other than disease status (2/2):** Controls were selected to match cases by age (Â±5 years) and sex; drawn from the same hospitals or communities without prior heart disease.

**Cases and controls matched appropriately (2/2):** Frequency matching by age and sex with stratification; unmatched logistic regression adjusted for these variables for consistency.

**Same criteria used for identification (2/2):** Myocardial infarction confirmed by symptoms and ECG changes. Controls required absence of CVD and exertional chest pain.

**Exposure measured in a standard, valid and reliable way (2/2):** Standardized questionnaires and biometric protocols (e.g., ApoB/ApoA1 assays using WHO-referenced kits).

**Exposure measured the same for cases and controls (2/2):** All interviews and physical exams conducted using identical methods; labs used same equipment and controls.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age, sex, region, and all other risk factors included in multivariate modeling to identify potential confounding.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for all matching and potential confounding factors.

**Outcomes assessed in standard, valid and reliable way (2/2):** Acute MI diagnosed using objective criteria (ECG, biomarkers); inclusion only of first MI reduced reverse causation risk.

**Exposure period long enough to be meaningful (2/2):** Assessed lifetime behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet) and long-term biomarker levels; well-aligned with MI latency periods.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Used unconditional logistic regression with sensitivity checks; PARs calculated using WHO-endorsed methods; subgroup analyses by sex, region, and age.

| Yusuf et al. (2004) | JBI Checklist for Case Control Studies | 20/20 | 100% | Landmark global study across 52 countries, n=27,098 (12,461 cases, 14,637 controls). Standardized measurement of 9 modifiable risk factors explained ~90% of myocardial infarction risk globally. All criteria fully met. |
