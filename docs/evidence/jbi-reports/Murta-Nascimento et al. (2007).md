### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups comparable other than disease status (2/2):** Cases and controls were selected from the same hospitals, with controls admitted for conditions unrelated to the exposures, which supports comparability.

**Matching of cases and controls (1/2):** While there is no explicit mention of matching procedures, the use of hospital-based controls with similar demographics suggests partial matching.

**Same criteria for case/control identification (2/2):** Both groups had eligibility assessed through structured clinical criteria, including histological confirmation for cases.

**Exposure measured in standard, valid, and reliable way (2/2):** Exposure data (family history of cancer) were collected using structured interviews with validated questions.

**Exposure measured same way for cases and controls (2/2):** Both groups underwent identical data collection procedures.

**Confounding factors identified (1/2):** The study acknowledges potential confounders such as shared environmental exposures, but provides limited enumeration or depth of analysis.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors (2/2):** Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for known confounders including smoking and occupational exposures.

**Outcomes assessed in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Bladder cancer diagnosis was histologically confirmed using WHO classification criteria; family history was self-reported, acknowledged as a limitation.

**Exposure period of interest long enough to be meaningful (2/2):** Family history implies long-term exposure; the study timeframe appropriately accommodates this risk exposure.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Statistical analysis included trend tests and stratified logistic regression, appropriate for case-control design.
