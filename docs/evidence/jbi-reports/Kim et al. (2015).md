# Kim et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The study assessed the association between cadmium exposure and lung cancer risk in a pooled European cohort .

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included only prospective studies with comparable data on cadmium exposure and lung cancer outcomes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Studies were identified from the ESCAPE project; this reflects a well-defined source pool.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Pooled seven European cohorts with detailed exposure estimates and covariate data.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No explicit description of a quality appraisal of included cohorts.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Data harmonization is described but no mention of independent appraisal or error-checking by multiple reviewers.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Centralized modeling of exposure and coordinated data pooling procedures are described.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Cox models stratified by study; random-effects meta-analysis used for cohort-specific HRs.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Authors state that pooled analyses can achieve high power with less publication bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Risk estimates and conclusions are consistently supported by pooled and cohort-specific analyses.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Suggests need for updated studies using refined exposure assessments and new geographic settings.

| Kim et al. (2015) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Strong pooled analysis of seven studies on cadmium exposure and lung cancer risk using individual data and harmonized exposure modeling; Item 5 – no formal critical appraisal of included studies; Item 6 – unclear whether assessment was independent; Item 9 – no publication bias analysis. |
