### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants were from the MONICA Augsburg population cohort, randomly sampled from the general population aged 25â€“74.

**Exposures measured similarly (2/2):** Sleep disturbance (initiation and maintenance) assessed uniformly at baseline via standardized questionnaires.

**Exposure measurement valid and reliable (2/2):** Though based on self-report, the questionnaire had defined categories with epidemiological validation and stratified analysis confirms construct validity.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Identified key confounders including BMI, age, hypertension, cholesterol, activity, education, smoking, alcohol, and parental history of diabetes.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Multivariable Cox models with sequential adjustment for five models, including BMI in the final model.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Prevalent diabetes cases and those with <2 years follow-up were excluded.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Diabetes diagnosis validated via medical records and physician verification.

**Follow-up time reported and adequate (2/2):** Mean follow-up was 7.5 years, sufficient to assess incident diabetes.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Response rate was 68%, and deceased cases were verified through medical records, minimizing attrition bias.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up described (2/2):** Follow-up strategies included registry checks, medical record reviews, and physician confirmation for non-respondents.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox models with gender-stratified analysis, incremental adjustment, and sensitivity analyses for smokers/non-smokers.
