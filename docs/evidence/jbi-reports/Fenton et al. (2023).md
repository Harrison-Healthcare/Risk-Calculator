# Fenton et al. (2023)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** Canadian Census provides a comprehensive and representative labor force dataset.

**Participants sampled appropriately (2/2):** Census-based enumeration by occupation, industry, and geography ensures inclusiveness.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** Based on entire 2016 Canadian workforce; over 15 million workers.

**Study subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Detailed breakdown by occupation, industry, sex, and province/territory.

**Data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage (2/2):** Covers national-level exposures; data stratified by sector, job, sex, and geography.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (1/2):** Exposure estimates derived via expert judgment; lacks direct measurements or validation studies.

**Condition measured in a standard, reliable way (1/2):** Exposure levels defined by consensus, but no consistent use of quantitative data or reproducible standards.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Weighted prevalence estimates calculated using validated census data and revised exposure proportions.

**Subpopulation response rates adequately managed (2/2):** Census response rates implicitly high; expert-based modeling adjusted for classification changes.
