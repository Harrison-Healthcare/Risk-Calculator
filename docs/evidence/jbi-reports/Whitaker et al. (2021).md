# Whitaker et al. (2021)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Criteria for inclusion clearly defined (2/2):** Included adults from two MIDUS cohorts with completed ACE survey modules; exclusion due to missing data was also reported.

**Study subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Detailed demographic breakdown and description of cohorts (MIDUS 2 and MIDUS Refresher), including age, sex, race, and SED.

**Exposure measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** ACEs were measured using MIDUS items mirroring BRFSS ACE categories; widely accepted retrospective method.

**Objective, standard criteria used for outcome measurement (1/2):** Outcomes (MDE, AD) measured via the CIDI-SF, which is validated but abbreviated; authors acknowledged potential misclassification.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age, race, and both childhood and current socioeconomic disadvantage were clearly identified and included as covariates.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** Adjustments were made through multivariable logistic regression and stratified interaction models.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (1/2):** Limitations due to self-report and abbreviated instruments (CIDI-SF) were acknowledged, along with possible recall and rater bias.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Used logistic regression, additive interaction contrasts (Knol & VanderWeele), and STROBE guidance to assess synergy.
