### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** The study used the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which includes a multistage, stratified probability sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** A randomly selected adult per household was surveyed each year, ensuring representativeness across sex, age, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** Total analytic sample was 618,812 adults with complete physical activity data across 21 years.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Data stratified by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, Census region, and BMI, with clear demographic distributions across time points.

**Sufficient coverage of sample in analysis (2/2):** Analysis accounted for response rates and applied NHIS weights; annual response rates ranged from 53% to 74%.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (2/2):** Physical activity levels classified using validated self-report questions and converted to moderate-intensity equivalent minutes per week based on CDC/PA guidelines.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** Measurement procedures remained unchanged over time, using consistent survey items with established reliability.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Analyses conducted using Stata and JoinPoint regression, adjusting for complex survey design and age-standardized to the 2000 U.S. population.

**Adequate response rate (2/2):** Missing data were low (<3%); all analyses followed NHIS analytic guidelines, ensuring data completeness and robustness.
