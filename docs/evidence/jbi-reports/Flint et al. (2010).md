# Flint et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants were all health professionals, free of CHD and cancer at baseline, drawn from the NHS and HPFS cohorts.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** BMI and waist circumference (WC) measured via self-report using standardized mailed instructions; validated against technician measurements (r = 0.95 men, 0.89 women).

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Self-reported anthropometry had high validity; BMI and WC were categorized using clinical cutoffs and deciles for dose-response analysis.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Adjusted for smoking, alcohol, diet (energy, fat, folate, vitamin E), comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia), and hormone therapy in women.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Extensive multivariable Cox regression modeling with and without comorbidity terms; subgroup and stratified analyses by sex and age.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Participants with prior myocardial infarction, angina, or cancer were excluded at baseline.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Incident CHD (nonfatal MI, fatal CHD) confirmed by physician review of medical records or death certificates.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** 16 years of follow-up (1988–2004); 2,996 CHD events (1,823 in men, 1,173 in women) observed.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Follow-up nearly complete due to biennial questionnaires and death registry linkage; minimal loss reported.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** While missingness was low, the paper does not explicitly detail strategies for handling missing data or dropout.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression, stratified analyses, AIC model comparison, and survival curves were applied to test predictive validity of BMI vs. WC.

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flint et al. (2010) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | Large, 16-year prospective study in two U.S. cohorts (NHS, HPFS). BMI and waist circumference independently predicted CHD risk; WC was a better predictor in older adults. Item 10 – no explicit reporting of strategies to handle loss to follow-up or missing data. |
