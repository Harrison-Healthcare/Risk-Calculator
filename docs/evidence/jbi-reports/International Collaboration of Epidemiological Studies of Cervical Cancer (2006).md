# International Collaboration of Epidemiological Studies of Cervical Cancer (2006)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Explicit objective to evaluate associations between smoking and histological types of cervical cancer.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included cohort and case-control studies with ≥30 invasive or 100+ CIN3 cases and information on smoking status.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Studies identified from prior systematic reviews, database searches, and international collaboration meetings.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Included published and unpublished studies from four continents with >70% of global available data on this topic.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Inclusion required individual-level data on cervical histology and smoking; strict exclusions applied (e.g., hysterectomy).

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers (2/2):** Data centrally reanalyzed and validated through consensus and meetings with principal investigators.

**Minimized data extraction errors (2/2):** Central harmonization of coding and cross-checks across multiple covariates (e.g., smoking, HPV, contraceptive use).

**Appropriate methods to combine studies (2/2):** Conditional logistic regression, floating absolute risks (FARs), and stratified modeling by study, age, sexual history, and contraceptive use.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** 7 eligible studies excluded due to unavailable data but showed similar results (RR = 1.73), minimizing bias risk.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear differential effects: squamous cell carcinoma risk increased (RR 1.60 current smokers), no effect for adenocarcinoma.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Emphasized the need for HPV-stratified longitudinal studies and detailed confounder assessment to resolve residual uncertainty.

| International Collaboration of Epidemiological Studies of Cervical Cancer (2006) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Pooled individual-level data from 23 studies (n=13,541 cases, 23,017 controls) using harmonized definitions and stratified regression. Clear dose–response with squamous cell carcinoma, but not adenocarcinoma. Robust stratification and HPV-adjusted models. All criteria fully met. |
