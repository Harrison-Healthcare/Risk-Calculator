# Bertoni et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants were part of the MESA study, free of baseline diabetes/CVD, and drawn from diverse but comparable populations.

**Exposures measured similarly (2/2):** CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen measured using standardized, centralized laboratory assays for all participants.

**Exposure measurement valid and reliable (2/2):** Assays had well-documented inter- and intra-assay CVs; standardized protocols used.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Acknowledged and adjusted for key confounders including BMI, HOMA-IR, age, race, smoking, and more.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Multiple regression models (with and without BMI, HOMA) used; stratified and sensitivity analyses performed.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Diabetes-free cohort at baseline, defined by fasting glucose and medication status.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident diabetes based on fasting glucose levels and medication use—standard clinical criteria.

**Follow-up time reported and adequate (2/2):** Median follow-up of 4.7 years, sufficient to detect new diabetes cases.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (1/2):** Exclusions noted (e.g., no follow-up visits), but detailed attrition or handling of missing data not described.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up described (1/2):** No imputation or detailed loss-to-follow-up strategy mentioned.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression models, stratified analysis, composite score creation, and log-transformed markers used robustly.

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bertoni et al. (2010) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 20/22 | 90.9% | Large, diverse cohort with strong outcome ascertainment and valid exposure measures. Item 9 – limited discussion of loss to follow-up; Item 10 – follow-up strategy underreported. Otherwise methodologically sound. |
