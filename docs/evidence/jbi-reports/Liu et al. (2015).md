# Liu et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** CARDIA and MESA participants were stratified by BP levels and treatment status, recruited from comparable populations.

**Exposures measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** Blood pressure was consistently measured across cohorts using standardized protocols.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** BP measurements followed standard guidelines, and cumulative BP was quantified over time.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Covariates including age, race, sex, cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and socioeconomic variables were explicitly adjusted for.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors (2/2):** Multivariable adjustment and stratified analyses were employed to control for confounding.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Only participants free of CVD at baseline and Y25 were included.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Outcomes such as LV mass index, coronary calcium score, and eGFR were based on standard imaging/lab procedures.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** CARDIA had 25 years of BP data; MESA had 9.5 years follow-up for CVD outcomes.

**Follow-up complete and reasons for loss described (1/2):** Some exclusions and missing data noted, but reasons for loss to follow-up were not fully explored.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Limited discussion of handling missing data or sensitivity analysis for attrition bias.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Multivariable regression, spline models, and stratified analyses were clearly justified and well executed.
