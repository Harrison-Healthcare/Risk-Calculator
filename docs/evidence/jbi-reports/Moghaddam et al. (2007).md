# Moghaddam et al. (2007)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aimed to quantify the association between general and central obesity and colorectal cancer risk, including dose-response and bias adjustment .

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included studies with quantitative effect estimates for BMI ≥30 or waist circumference, excluding mortality-only or non-adjusted reports.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE up to April 2007 using MeSH and text terms for cancer, BMI, waist circumference, and study type.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Included published cohort and case-control studies from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Studies were excluded if they lacked SEs, adjustment for age, or incident cancer outcome.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Data extracted independently by two authors and consensus methods used for inclusion.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized RR derivation, inverse variance weighting, and harmonized BMI categories across all pooled estimates

| Moghaddam et al. (2007) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Pooled 31 studies (23 cohort, 8 case-control) covering 70,000 colorectal cancer events. Quantified sex, site-specific, and dose–response risk with BMI and waist circumference. Publication bias accounted for. All JBI criteria met. |
