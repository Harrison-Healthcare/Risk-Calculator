# Ford & Cooper (1991)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All participants from NHANES I (1971–1975), aged 25–74, representative of U.S. adults.

**Exposures measured similarly for groups (2/2):** Variables like BMI, diet, and serum markers were measured uniformly using NHANES protocols.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** NHANES used standardized 24-hour dietary recalls and clinical assessments.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Education, income, physical activity, BMI, alcohol, and dietary cations were discussed as potential confounders.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** Multivariable logistic regression used for adjustment; stratified analyses also conducted.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Hypertension at baseline was explicitly excluded using BP measures and medication history.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Follow-up BP measured by protocol, consistent with AHA criteria; antihypertensive medication use also tracked.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** 10-year average follow-up is adequate to observe incident hypertension.

**Follow-up complete, or differences described (1/2):** While large numbers were retained, details on losses or attrition mechanisms are limited.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up utilized (1/2):** No imputation or sensitivity analysis described for missing follow-up cases.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Logistic regression, ANOVA, and chi-square tests appropriately applied; adjusted for multiple covariates.
