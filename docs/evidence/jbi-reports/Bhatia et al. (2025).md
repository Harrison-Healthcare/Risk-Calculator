### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similarity of groups (2/2):** Participants from large population-based cohorts (MESA and UK Biobank), all free of CVD at baseline.

**Exposure measured similarly (2/2):** Lp(a) assayed uniformly (latex-enhanced in MESA; immunoturbidimetric in UKB) for all participants.

**Validity/reliability of exposure (2/2):** Assay methods described for both cohorts; standardized protocols imply high reliability.

**Confounders identified (2/2):** Age, sex, and key clinical variables noted as potential confounders in analysis plan.

**Strategies for confounding (2/2):** Cox models adjusted for age and sex; additional sensitivity analyses reported.

**Outcome-free at baseline (2/2):** Participants with prior CVD events excluded.

**Outcome measurement (2/2):** CVD endpoints adjudicated via centralized registries/ICD-10 codes.

**Sufficient follow-up (2/2):** Up to 10 years of follow-up (2000–2018 for MESA; 2006–2022 for UKB).

**Complete follow-up (1/2):** Some participants lost (n = 31 in MESA); reasons not detailed.

**Addressing incomplete follow-up (2/2):** National registry linkage minimizes impact of attrition.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Cox hazards, Kaplan-Meier, reclassification metrics, and C-index used appropriately.
