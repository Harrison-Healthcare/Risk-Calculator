# Manninen et al. (1992)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was true randomization used for assignment of participants to treatment groups? (2/2):** Random allocation of 4,081 men to gemfibrozil or placebo groups is described clearly.

**Was allocation to treatment groups concealed? (1/2):** Randomization is mentioned but concealment procedures are not specified.

**Were treatment groups similar at the baseline? (2/2):** Baseline characteristics including cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides were similar between groups.

**Were participants blind to treatment assignment? (2/2):** The trial is stated as double-blind.

**Were those delivering treatment blind to treatment assignment? (2/2):** The trial is stated as double-blind.

**Were treatment groups treated identically other than the intervention of interest? (2/2):** Identical follow-up procedures and assessments for both groups.

**Were outcome assessors blind to treatment assignment? (2/2):** The trial is stated as double-blind.

**Were outcomes measured in the same way for treatment groups? (2/2):** Consistent outcome definitions (e.g., MI, cardiac death) applied across groups.

**Were outcomes measured in a reliable way? (2/2):** Use of standard clinical and ECG criteria for myocardial infarction and deaths.

**Was follow-up complete and, if not, were differences between groups adequately described and analyzed? (2/2):** Regular 3-month follow-ups; no substantial differential loss reported.

**Were participants analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized? (2/2):** Analysis appears to follow intention-to-treat principles.

**Was appropriate statistical analysis used? (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models and subgroup analysis were properly applied.

**Was the trial design appropriate, and were any deviations from the standard RCT design accounted for in the conduct and analysis of the trial? (2/2):** The design and statistical modeling (including subgroup dummy variable analysis) were robust and appropriate for the hypotheses tested.
