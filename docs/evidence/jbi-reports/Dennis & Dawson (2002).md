### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clear aim to evaluate associations between sexual activity and prostate cancer.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Defined inclusion of analytic studies measuring aspects of sexual behavior.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Thorough search strategy using MEDLINE with specific terms.

**Sources and resources used adequate (2/2):** Included database searches, author contacts, and manual reference checks.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No description of tools or criteria for methodological quality appraisal.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by two or more reviewers (1/2):** Not stated if multiple reviewers assessed studies independently.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Used standard extraction with detailed RR and variance computations.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Appropriate use of fixed and random-effects models with heterogeneity analysis.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Assessed using fail-safe N and discussed in results.

**Recommendations supported by reported data (2/2):** Recommendations consistent with findings, especially regarding STIs and prostate cancer.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Called for research on biological mechanisms and confounding control.

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dennis & Dawson (2002) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | High-quality meta-analysis with comprehensive synthesis and valid statistical methods. Item 5 – criteria for appraising studies not described; Item 6 – unclear if critical appraisal was independent. All other items well addressed, including publication bias assessment (fail-safe N) and bias impact discussion. |
