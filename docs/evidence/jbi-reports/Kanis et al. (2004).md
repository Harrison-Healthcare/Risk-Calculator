# Kanis et al. (2004)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Focused on estimating fracture risk from prior fracture across multiple sites and populations .

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included prospective cohorts with individual-level fracture data.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Data derived from 12 known population-based cohorts; systematic selection of studies clearly explained.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Included >60,000 individuals across multiple countries with long-term follow-up.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No explicit description of critical appraisal criteria or quality assessment tool.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (0/2):** No indication that any appraisal (if done) was conducted independently.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Used original datasets with standardized data harmonization and central analysis.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Poisson regression modeling with random-effects meta-analysis and sensitivity checks.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Reduced bias by relying on cohort data rather than published estimates; discussed heterogeneity.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear conclusions on risk magnitudes by sex, age, and site with visual support (Figures 1–3).

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Suggested incorporation of fracture history into fracture risk models like FRAX.

| Kanis et al. (2004) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 18/22 | 81.8% | Meta-analysis of prior fracture and future fracture risk from 12 cohort studies; used original data and advanced modeling; Item 5 – no critical appraisal tool described; Item 6 – unclear if quality assessment was done independently. |
