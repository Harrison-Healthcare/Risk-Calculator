# Li et al. (2014)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The study aimed to assess the association between breastfeeding and ovarian cancer risk.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included observational studies that provided effect estimates of breastfeeding and ovarian cancer risk.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE up to March 2013, including reference list checks.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Included 40 studies (5 cohort, 35 case-control) with over 17,000 ovarian cancer cases.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Study quality was assessed using the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).

**Critical appraisal conducted independently (2/2):** Appraisal was performed independently by two reviewers.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Dual extraction with consensus resolution; data collected on exposures, outcomes, confounders.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects model used; subgroup and meta-regression analyses applied.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and both Begg’s and Egger’s tests used, with no significant publication bias found.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear pooled RR estimates presented for total, subgroup, and duration-stratified breastfeeding exposures.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Encourages future prospective studies with standardized breastfeeding measures and duration reporting.
