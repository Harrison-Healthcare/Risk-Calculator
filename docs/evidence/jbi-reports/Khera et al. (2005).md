### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Were the criteria for inclusion in the sample clearly defined? (2/2):** Inclusion criteria specified adults aged 30–65 who completed the second Dallas Heart Study visit with available CRP data. Sampling restricted to Black and White participants due to sample size limitations in other groups.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** The study described age, sex, BMI, comorbidities, and medication use by race and gender group (Table 1, page 2), and outlined the setting as a multiethnic, urban U.S. sample.

**Was the exposure measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** CRP was measured using a high-sensitivity immunoturbidimetric assay (Tina-quant, Roche) with strong reliability and clinical validation.

**Were objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition? (2/2):** CRP levels were categorized per CDC/AHA risk thresholds (e.g., ≥3 mg/L = high risk). These standard cutoffs were used consistently across all analyses.

**Were confounding factors identified? (2/2):** The study identified key confounders including age, BMI, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol levels, estrogen/statin use, and creatinine.

**Were strategies to deal with confounding factors stated? (2/2):** Used multivariable logistic and linear regression models adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and sampling weights (Figure 3, page 5).

**Were the outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** CRP was consistently defined and measured. Outcomes (proportion of individuals in CRP risk categories) were computed using weighted analyses and validated cutoffs.

**Was appropriate statistical analysis used? (2/2):** Applied stratified and multivariate models, chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regression using SUDAAN and Stata, with multiple sensitivity analyses (Table 4, Figure 4, page 5).

| Khera et al. (2005) | JBI Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies | 16/16 | 100% | Strong population-based cross-sectional study using the Dallas Heart Study to examine race and gender differences in CRP levels. Probability sampling, validated assays, and multivariable adjustment fully meet JBI criteria. |
