# Berg et al. (2008)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The study examined associations between alcohol use and bone outcomes including fracture risk and bone density.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Defined by adult exposure to alcohol and reporting of bone-related outcomes in valid designs (RCTs, cohort, case-control).

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE, Current Contents, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Libraries with well-defined terms.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Included 33 studies with diverse populations and outcomes (fracture, BMD, remodeling).

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Used USPSTF internal validity criteria; excluded studies rated "poor".

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Dual independent reviewers assessed abstracts and resolved disagreements via discussion.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Data extracted by two authors using predefined templates; one investigator contacted study authors for clarification.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used dose–response and random-effects meta-analysis for hip fracture and BMD, with separate synthesis for other outcomes.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Egger’s test used to detect bias for pooled outcomes.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** J-shaped relationship for hip fractures and linear BMD association supported with dose–response plots (see Figures 2 & 3, pp. 14–15).

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Advocated for better confounder control and longer follow-up in future studies, especially for moderate vs heavy drinkers.
