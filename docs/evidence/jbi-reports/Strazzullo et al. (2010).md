# Strazzullo et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Explicit aim to quantify the association of BMI categories with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included prospective studies with ≥4 years follow-up and BMI-stratified stroke incidence data.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, HTA, and manual screening of reference lists.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Multi-database strategy plus author contact ensured inclusion of relevant unpublished data.

**Criteria for appraising studies (2/2):** Used the Downs and Black score to evaluate study quality; all included studies scored ≥15/19.

**Independent appraisal by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Two authors extracted data independently; disagreements resolved by third reviewer.

**Methods to minimize errors in extraction (2/2):** Extraction discrepancies resolved via consensus and arbitration; author queries for missing data also conducted.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Log-transformed RRs pooled using random-effects models due to significant heterogeneity (I² > 75% in all analyses).

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Used funnel plots, Egger’s test, and Trim-and-Fill method to assess and adjust for bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Findings clearly support graded increase in ischemic stroke risk with BMI; conclusions consistent with subgroup, sensitivity, and adjusted analyses.

**Specific directives for future research (2/2):** Identified need for studies on BMI <25, and on visceral vs peripheral adiposity; also discussed J-shaped risk patterns.
