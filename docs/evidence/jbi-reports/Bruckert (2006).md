### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was the sample frame appropriate to address the target population? (2/2):** The Pan-European Survey enrolled adults with diagnosed dyslipidaemia under specialist care from 11 European countries, targeting the intended high-risk population.

**Were study participants sampled in an appropriate way? (2/2):** Physicians enrolled the first eligible patient seen on 3–5 consecutive days, minimizing selection bias and yielding a representative clinical sample.

**Was the sample size adequate? (2/2):** The final sample included 8,545 patients, more than sufficient to estimate prevalence with narrow confidence intervals and subgroup analyses across age, sex, and geography.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Detailed demographic and clinical information (e.g., age, BMI, comorbidities, medication use) was provided (see Table 2, page F19).

**Was the data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage of the identified sample? (2/2):** Prevalence was calculated for the entire cohort and stratified by sex, treatment status, and country, with graphical representation (Figures 2–3, page F20).

**Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition? (2/2):** Low HDL-C was defined using NCEP ATP III cutoffs: <1.03 mmol/L for men and <1.29 mmol/L for women, a validated and guideline-based definition.

**Was the condition measured in a standard, reliable way for all participants? (2/2):** All participants had HDL-C measured through standardized biochemical assays; definitions and cutoffs were uniformly applied across the survey.

**Was there appropriate statistical analysis? (2/2):** Descriptive statistics and stratified comparisons were used, with attention to treatment vs. no-treatment groups and country-level variability.

**Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low response rate managed appropriately? (2/2):** While explicit response rate isn't stated, the survey design (consecutive sampling over multiple days) and high enrollment suggest good coverage; exclusions and missing data were transparently described (e.g., obesity data missing in 3%).

| Bruckert (2006) | JBI Checklist for Prevalence Studies | 18/18 | 100% | Well-designed, multinational prevalence study of low HDL-C in 8,545 European patients treated for dyslipidaemia. Standardized measurement criteria, broad population coverage, and consistent subgroup reporting support full methodological validity. |
