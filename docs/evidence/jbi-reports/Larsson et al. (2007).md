# Larsson et al. (2007)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly defined objective to evaluate the association between BMI and pancreatic cancer using prospective studies.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included only prospective studies that reported RRs/CIs for ≥3 BMI categories or per-unit increase in BMI.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE from 1966 to November 2006 using a comprehensive keyword strategy and citation chasing.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Identified 21 independent studies with >3.4 million participants and over 8,000 cases across global cohorts.

**Appraisal criteria appropriate (1/2):** Study quality indicators (e.g., exposure assessment method, diabetes adjustment) were examined, but no formal critical appraisal tool used.

**Independent critical appraisal (2/2):** Two authors collaborated on study selection and data extraction, with consensus procedures in place.

**Minimized extraction errors (2/2):** Extracted standardized fields such as anthropometry type, confounder control, and regression inputs; sensitivity analyses conducted.

**Combination of studies appropriate (2/2):** Used random-effects models and dose-response meta-regression; explored sources of heterogeneity and stratified effects (e.g., sex, region).

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Evaluated using Egger’s test (p = 0.58), indicating no publication bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Results support a modest but consistent increase in pancreatic cancer risk per 5 kg/m² BMI increase, with biologic rationale discussed.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Encouraged exploration of central obesity metrics and metabolic pathways in future studies.
