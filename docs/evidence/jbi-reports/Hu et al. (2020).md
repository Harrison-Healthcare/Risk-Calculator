# Hu et al. (2020)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** The study aimed to evaluate the association between 5-ARIs and prostate cancer incidence/mortality; clearly articulated in title, abstract, and introduction.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included population-based studies that compared prediagnostic 5-ARI users to nonusers or placebo, reporting incidence/mortality outcomes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to October 2019; followed PRISMA guidelines.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Used three major databases and manual reference checks; detailed flow diagram (Figure 1, p. 3) confirms exhaustive screening.

**Appraisal criteria appropriate (2/2):** Used Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs.

**Independent critical appraisal (2/2):** Two investigators independently assessed quality and resolved disagreements with a third party.

**Minimized extraction errors (2/2):** Dual data extraction conducted; clear variables listed (e.g., age, follow-up, drug exposure, clinical outcomes).

**Combination of studies appropriate (2/2):** Used RR and HR as effect sizes; applied random-effects model when heterogeneity was present; conducted subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Egger’s and Begg’s tests applied for overall and Gleason 8–10 PCa; no significant bias found.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Findings clearly align with the data: reduced risk for overall PCa, increased for high-grade, no increase in mortality.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Discussed limitations, subgroup effects (e.g., exposure time, population), and called for better-designed studies with more survival data.

| Hu et al. (2020) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | High-quality meta-analysis of 23 studies (RCTs, cohort, case-control), using formal quality tools (NOS and Cochrane RoB). Risk of bias assessed independently; robust synthesis and sensitivity analyses; publication bias formally tested. |
