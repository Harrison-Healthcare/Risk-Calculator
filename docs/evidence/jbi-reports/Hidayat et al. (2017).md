# JBI Score Hidayat et al. (2017)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** The study aimed to assess the association and dose–response relationship between blood pressure and kidney cancer risk in prospective studies.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included only prospective cohort, nested case-control, or case-cohort designs assessing BP or hypertension with reported RRs/HRs/ORs for kidney cancer incidence.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic search conducted in PubMed and Web of Science without restrictions; supplemented by reference list screening.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** Inclusion of two major databases and hand-searching ensures adequate coverage.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (2/2):** Quality assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), with results in Supplementary Tables S1–S2; scores ≥7 considered high quality.

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (2/2):** Dual independent assessment described, with discrepancies resolved via discussion.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Standardized form used to extract study characteristics, risk estimates, and adjustments.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model used; heterogeneity tested (Q and I²); publication bias assessed with Egger/Begg tests and trim-and-fill correction.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Both Egger's and Begg’s tests were conducted; results were robust after trim-and-fill adjustment.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Recommendations based on pooled RRs, dose–response analysis, and subgroup/sensitivity analyses.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Suggested studies focusing on racial/ethnic disparities, antihypertensive treatment effects, and biological mechanisms.
