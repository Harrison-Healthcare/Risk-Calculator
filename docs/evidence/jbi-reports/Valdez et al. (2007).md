### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was the sample frame appropriate to address the target population? (2/2):** Used NHANES (1999–2004), a multistage, stratified survey designed to represent the non-institutionalized U.S. adult population.

**Were study participants sampled in an appropriate way? (2/2):** Participants were selected using probability-based sampling with weights for national estimates and morning fasting subsample used for undiagnosed diabetes.

**Was the sample size adequate? (2/2):** Final sample included 16,388 adults with interview data and 6,004 with fasting glucose data, enabling reliable subgroup estimates and confidence intervals.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Provided detailed stratification by age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, education, income, and hypertension (Tables 1–2).

**Was the data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage of the identified sample? (2/2):** Analyses used appropriate NHANES weights for interview and morning exam components, ensuring representativeness and minimizing bias.

**Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition? (2/2):** Diabetes defined using self-reported diagnosis or fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL; approach consistent with ADA standards.

**Was the condition measured in a standard, reliable way for all participants? (2/2):** Diabetes diagnosis methods applied consistently across all participants with fasting data; clear differentiation between diagnosed and undiagnosed cases.

**Was there appropriate statistical analysis? (2/2):** Used SUDAAN for survey-weighted logistic regression and predictive margins; adjustments for BMI, age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, and education were included.

**Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low response rate managed appropriately? (2/2):** Response rates were adjusted through sample weights; exclusions clearly stated for pregnant women, those missing data, or outside fasting time ranges.
