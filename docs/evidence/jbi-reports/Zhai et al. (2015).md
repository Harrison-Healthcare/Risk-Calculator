### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Yes. The study aimed to determine whether short or long sleep duration increases the risk of incident depression in adults .

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Yes. Included only prospective cohort studies among adults, measuring sleep duration at baseline and depression outcomes at follow-up with multivariable-adjusted RRs.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Searched PubMed and Web of Science up to October 2014 with a combination of sleep and depression terms. Followed PRISMA guidelines and screened 37,378 articles.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Yes. Two major databases were used, and reference lists of retrieved articles were screened. No language restrictions were applied.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale; scores were reported for each study in Table 1 (page 4).

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Yes. Two investigators independently reviewed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed quality, resolving discrepancies through consensus.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Yes. Extraction involved independent review, structured eligibility criteria, and complete duplicate screening and quality scoring.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models, subgroup/meta-regression, and I² to assess heterogeneity. Pooled RR estimates were displayed in forest plots (Figures 2–3, p. 5).

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Yes. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Begg’s test, and Egger’s regression (all p > .05) with results showing no significant bias.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Yes. Authors advised monitoring both short and long sleep duration as modifiable risk factors for depression and emphasized preventive interventions.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Suggested more longitudinal studies using objective sleep measurement and clear definitions of sleep categories to explore causal pathways.
