# Ford et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants recruited from the EPIC-Potsdam cohort, a general German population sample aged 35–65.

**Exposures measured similarly (2/2):** TV viewing hours self-reported at baseline using a standardized question across all participants.

**Exposure measurement valid and reliable (2/2):** Though self-reported, the exposure (TV hours/day) was operationalized consistently and previously validated in similar cohorts.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Numerous confounders identified including lifestyle, diet, anthropometrics, blood pressure.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Extensive multivariable modeling with incremental adjustment for confounders and mediators across 11 models.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Diabetes-free participants confirmed at baseline via physician-verified records and interviews.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident diabetes cases confirmed via physician-reported diagnostic details and ICD coding (ICD-10: E11).

**Follow-up time reported and adequate (2/2):** Mean follow-up of 7.8 years, sufficient for T2D development.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** >90% follow-up rate reported, response tracking described.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up described (1/2):** While high follow-up rate achieved, specific analytical strategies for handling any attrition not detailed.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression with age as the time scale, multiple confounder-adjusted models, and tests for linear trend performed.
