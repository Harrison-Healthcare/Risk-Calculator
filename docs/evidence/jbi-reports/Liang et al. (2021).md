### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** The objective is to assess whether hearing loss is an independent risk factor for dementia in community-based adults.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Included only prospective cohort studies in general populations, with multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Search strategy was explicitly described, using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library with a comprehensive combination of keywords related to hearing loss, dementia, and cohort design.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Search included all major biomedical databases and additional citation checks; only English-language full-text articles were included.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), with detailed item-level scoring reported in Table 2.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Dual independent reviewers performed the search, data extraction, and appraisal, resolving disagreements through discussion with senior authors.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Data were extracted by two independent reviewers using structured methods, with consensus-based resolution of discrepancies.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Used random-effects models for pooling hazard ratios (HRs), with sensitivity, subgroup, and dose-response analyses; I² and Cochrane Q were reported.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Assessed visually via funnel plots and statistically using Egger’s test; conducted trim-and-fill analysis to assess robustness of findings.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Authors concluded that hearing loss is an independent risk factor for dementia and highlighted potential for early intervention.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Recommended trials to assess whether hearing rehabilitation can prevent cognitive decline; noted need for individual-level meta-analyses and studies stratified by hearing loss severity.

| Liang et al. (2021) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 22/22 | 100% | Methodologically excellent meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies (726,900 participants) assessing the association between hearing loss and dementia risk. Comprehensive data extraction, risk of bias evaluation, subgroup analyses, and publication bias adjustments all well executed. |
