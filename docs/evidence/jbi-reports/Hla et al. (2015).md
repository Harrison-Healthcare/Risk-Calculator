### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similarity of groups (2/2):** Participants drawn from a state employee sampling frame, followed prospectively from baseline polysomnography; recruitment and population base were consistent.

**Exposure measured similarly (2/2):** All underwent in-lab overnight polysomnography using standardized 18-channel setup and scoring criteria.

**Validity/reliability of exposure (2/2):** Apnea and hypopnea events were defined per standard AASM criteria and scored by trained technicians blinded to outcome.

**Confounders identified (2/2):** Age, sex, BMI, smoking, diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, physical activity, and sleep duration identified as confounders or mediators.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking, and other variables; interactions examined and time-varying models used.

**Outcome-free at baseline (2/2):** Participants with baseline CHD or heart failure excluded from analysis.

**Outcome measurement (2/2):** CHD/HF events identified via detailed questionnaires, confirmed with follow-ups and adjudicated by a blinded physician.

**Sufficient follow-up (2/2):** Follow-up period extended up to 24 years with a total of 17,978 person-years.

**Complete follow-up (1/2):** No specific detail on losses to follow-up or reasons for missing data, though regular mailings and visit-based follow-up occurred.

**Addressing incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Outcome adjudication, use of mailed surveys, and death record linkage minimized potential attrition bias.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Cox regression, time-varying exposures, and sensitivity analyses were all well-justified and appropriate.
