# Ben et al. (2011)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Explicit aim to examine the association between diabetes and pancreatic cancer risk.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included only cohort/nested case-control studies with estimable risk metrics and appropriate outcomes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic search of Medline and Embase, plus citation tracking, with no language restrictions.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Extensive time frame and database coverage; includes both incidence and mortality-based risk estimates.

**Appraisal criteria appropriate (0/2):** No formal or informal critical appraisal of included studies conducted.

**Independent critical appraisal (1/2):** Dual review for inclusion and data extraction, but no independent assessment of methodological quality.

**Minimized extraction errors (2/2):** Data extraction independently verified, with structured protocol for exposure, outcome, and confounder data.

**Combination of studies appropriate (2/2):** Applied random-effects meta-analysis, stratified analyses, and dose-duration modeling.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot and Egger’s test showed no significant bias (p = 0.136).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear conclusions based on robust summary RRs, with biologically plausible interpretations.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Encourages investigation into cancer-associated diabetes mechanisms and early detection markers.
