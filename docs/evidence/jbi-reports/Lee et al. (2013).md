# Lee et al. (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The study explicitly investigates whether diabetes mellitus increases lung cancer risk.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Only observational studies with RR/OR and 95% CIs on diabetes and lung cancer included.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive database search including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to September 2012.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Multiple databases searched with supplementary manual reference checks.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used and described as a basis for assessing study quality.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Data extraction and quality assessments were performed by two independent reviewers.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Discrepancies resolved through discussion with a third reviewer.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random effects models and heterogeneity assessed via I²; subgroup and sensitivity analyses conducted.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Assessed using Egger's and Begg’s tests, as well as contour-enhanced funnel plots.

**Recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Findings are cautiously interpreted, but discussion of bias impact on conclusions is limited.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Final paragraphs suggest large-scale prospective studies and gender-stratified analyses to clarify the role of diabetes in lung cancer etiology.
