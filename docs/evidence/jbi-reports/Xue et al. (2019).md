# Xue et al. (2019)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Clearly aims to assess associations between diabetes (and related factors) and cognitive disorders including MCI and dementia.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Included only prospective studies, clearly defined exposures (diabetes, prediabetes, biochemical markers), and cognitive outcomes.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Comprehensive PubMed search up to June 2019; detailed search terms provided; supplementary hand-search conducted.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** PubMed and manual citation review used; large screening process (28,082 records) ensures completeness.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Study quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale; detailed application explained and quality scores reported (mean score 7.75/9).

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Data extraction and quality appraisal done independently by at least two researchers, with discrepancies resolved by discussion.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Systematic double-checking by independent reviewers, structured forms, and consensus discussions were used.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Random-effects models used; sensitivity, subgroup, and dose-response analyses applied where appropriate.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Egger’s test, Begg’s test, funnel plots, and trim-and-fill methods were used to evaluate and adjust for publication bias.

**Were the recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Recommends early glycemic control and specific drug interventions (e.g., pioglitazone) based on statistically significant pooled RRs.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Identifies gaps in insulin-related mechanisms, prediabetes monitoring, and calls for randomized trials of pioglitazone and glycemic management strategies.
