# Magnusson et al. (1999)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Cases and controls matched on age; relatives identified from comprehensive Swedish national registries.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Exposure is biological relationship to case/control; this was uniformly determined using national family registries.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** National register data used for family links, ensuring high accuracy and completeness.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Considered environmental transmission of HPV, regional variation, and screening effects as potential confounders.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (1/2):** While vertical HPV transmission and shared environment were considered, adjustments were limited and residual confounding is possible.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Relatives were followed from cohort entry with clear exclusion criteria (e.g., hysterectomy, no parental ID, adopted status).

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Cervical cancer outcomes identified from the Swedish Cancer Register, covering all diagnoses from 1958–1993.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Person-years calculated from 1958 to diagnosis or end of 1993; long-term follow-up with near-complete outcome ascertainment.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Registers ensured virtually complete follow-up; adopted/non-biological siblings and deceased controls excluded.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Although completeness is implied, specific strategies for handling missing data or losses not described.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Relative risks computed using observed-to-expected incidence ratios, with confidence intervals adjusted for multiple sibships.

| Magnusson et al. (1999) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 20/22 | 90.9% | Nationwide registry-based cohort linking family and cancer data with comprehensive follow-up. Item 5 – potential for residual confounding (e.g., shared environment) not fully adjusted; Item 10 – strategies for loss to follow-up or missing registry data not discussed. |
