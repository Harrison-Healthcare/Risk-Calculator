# Vallance et al. (2011)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Were the criteria for inclusion in the sample clearly defined? (2/2):** Yes. Included ambulatory U.S. adults aged ≥20 with ≥4 valid days of accelerometer data and completed PHQ-9 depression screener.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Yes. Detailed NHANES sampling procedures and demographic characteristics (age, sex, BMI, education, marital status) provided in Table 1 (p. 3).

**Was the exposure measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** Yes. MVPA and sedentary time were measured with ActiGraph accelerometers using validated thresholds and wear-time correction methods.

**Were objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition? (2/2):** Yes. Depression was diagnosed using PHQ-9 based on DSM-IV criteria, which is a validated and widely used diagnostic tool.

**Were confounding factors identified? (2/2):** Yes. Confounders included age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, BMI, smoking, chronic illness, and dietary intake.

**Were strategies to deal with confounding factors stated? (2/2):** Yes. Two models of logistic regression were presented—one adjusted for basic demographics and the other for all covariates and mutual adjustment for MVPA/sedentary time.

**Were the outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** Yes. The outcome (PHQ-9 depression diagnosis) was based on structured, standardized criteria consistent with clinical practice.

**Was appropriate statistical analysis used? (2/2):** Yes. Used weighted logistic regression with linearized variance estimation appropriate for complex survey design; subgroup interaction analyses were conducted and presented (e.g., Fig. 1, p. 4).

| Vallance et al. (2011) | JBI Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies | 16/16 | 100% | Methodologically rigorous cross-sectional study using NHANES 2005–2006 data to assess associations between objectively measured physical activity/sedentary time and depression. Strong sampling, validated tools (PHQ-9, accelerometers), and full confounder adjustment support all criteria met. |
