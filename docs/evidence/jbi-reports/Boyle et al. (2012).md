# Boyle et al. (2012)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim to assess whether diabetes is associated with increased breast cancer risk is explicitly stated in title, abstract, and introduction.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included observational studies reporting relative risk of breast cancer in women with diabetes, with clear eligibility criteria (incident cases, control groups, design types).

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** MOOSE-guided search strategy in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, and manual citation searches; full coverage up to Oct 2011.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Major databases and cross-checking of references ensured broad capture of studies.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Inclusion restricted to original, peer-reviewed studies reporting RRs with or without adjustment for BMI and menopausal status; studies without CIs were handled cautiously.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Dual extraction with third-party arbitration for discrepancies was used.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized forms and statistical recalculation for studies with incomplete variance data enhanced reliability.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects model used; log-transformation of RRs, I² heterogeneity statistics, subgroup/meta-regression, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis included.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot and three formal tests (Egger’s, Begg’s, Macaskill’s) showed no evidence of bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clearly concluded a 27% increased risk, primarily in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes, attenuated to 16% with BMI adjustment.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Encourages exploration of causal mechanisms (e.g., hyperinsulinaemia, IGF-1, adiposity pathways) and differentiated impacts by diabetes type.
