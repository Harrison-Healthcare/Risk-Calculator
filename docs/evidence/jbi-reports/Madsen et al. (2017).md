# Madsen et al. (2017)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Yes. Clearly aims to assess whether job strain is a risk factor for clinically diagnosed depression using published and IPD data.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Yes. Included prospective cohort studies with individual-level job strain assessment and clinical depression diagnosis via interview or hospital records.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Conducted systematic search using PubMed and PsycNET with additional reference list and citation searching per PRISMA guidelines (Fig. S1).

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Yes. Comprehensive inclusion of both published studies and 14 IPD-Work cohorts from Europe and Canada; authors contacted investigators to retrieve missing estimates.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Used Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for assessing study quality (see Supplementary Table S3).

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Yes. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and quality, with discrepancies resolved by discussion.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Yes. Standardized data extraction forms used, and for IPD data, a harmonized analytic plan was followed with study-specific analyses pooled centrally.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Random-effects meta-analysis used; IPD analyzed using Cox regression with robust adjustment, heterogeneity assessed with I² and τ².

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Yes. Compared published vs. unpublished IPD estimates, explored publication bias, and discussed overestimation risks in published data.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Yes. Recommended recognizing job strain as a risk factor in clinical settings and emphasized relevance for workplace interventions.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Advocated for trials targeting job strain to reduce depressive symptoms and called for broader exploration of other work-related stressors.
