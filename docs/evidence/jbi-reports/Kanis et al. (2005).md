# Kanis et al. (2005)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Explicit goal to quantify fracture risk from smoking across multiple cohorts.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included prospective cohorts with fracture outcomes and BMD measures.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Based on known cohorts from international studies; data sourced directly from investigators.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Data from 10 international cohorts, totaling over 59,000 individuals and 250,000 person-years.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No quality appraisal criteria or checklist was reported for included cohorts.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Cohort selection was described but no indication of independent quality assessment.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Authors used original, harmonized datasets and standardized covariate definitions.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used Poisson regression with age-adjusted beta coefficients; fixed-effects models justified by low heterogeneity.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Publication bias minimized by using original cohort data instead of relying solely on published results.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear reporting of adjusted risk ratios and age trends for various fracture types.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Encourages further study of dose–response and mechanisms behind BMD-independent fracture risk.

| Kanis et al. (2005) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Meta-analysis using primary data from 10 cohorts to assess smoking and fracture risk; robust design with Poisson modeling and sensitivity analyses; Item 5 – no formal critical appraisal; Item 6 – no mention of independent quality review. |
