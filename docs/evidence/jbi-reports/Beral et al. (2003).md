### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Over 1 million women aged 50–64 years recruited from NHS Breast Screening Programme, ensuring consistency across sociodemographic variables.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Baseline HRT use was self-reported via standardized questionnaire and validated against general practitioner records with 96–97% accuracy.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** HRT categorized by type, dose, duration, and formulation using British National Formulary data; self-report showed high agreement with prescription records.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Included age, time since menopause, BMI, parity, age at first birth, family history, alcohol, region, deprivation index.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox regression stratified by age and adjusted for 10+ covariates; floating absolute risk approach used for multi-group comparisons.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Women with any prior breast cancer were excluded from the analysis.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Cancer incidence and mortality recorded via NHS Central Registers using ICD-10 codes (C50 for breast cancer).

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up of 2.6 years for incidence and 4.1 years for mortality yielded 9364 breast cancer cases and 637 deaths.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Minimal loss expected due to routine flagging in national registers; ascertainment through NHS Central Registers ensured near-complete follow-up.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Some mention of participant switching or stopping HRT, but no detailed imputation, sensitivity, or correction strategies for time-varying exposures.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression with stratification and subgroup analyses by HRT type, dose, and duration; sensitivity analyses confirm robustness.

| Beral et al. (2003) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | Very large, nationally representative UK cohort with rigorous exposure/outcome ascertainment and comprehensive statistical modeling. Item 10 – strategies for handling loss to follow-up or post-baseline exposure changes not detailed, although follow-up via national registries was robust. |
