### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants were men aged 40+ with PSA testing in Stockholm County; exclusions applied uniformly.

**Exposure measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** Exposure to 5-ARI derived from national prescription registry using consistent criteria.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (1/2):** Prescription records captured accurately, but no confirmation of actual drug intake; analysis treated as intention-to-treat.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age, PSA, prior biopsy, family history, civil status, and education level were all considered as potential confounders.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Used two levels of multivariable Cox models, including PSA and interactions as time-dependent covariates.

**Groups free of outcome at start (2/2):** Entry delayed by 1 year post-PSA test to exclude men with prevalent cancers, ensuring outcome-free baseline.

**Outcomes measured validly and reliably (2/2):** All prostate cancer cases and Gleason scores sourced from regional pathology units and cancer registries.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Maximum 8-year follow-up allowed assessment of exposure-duration effects, including high-grade cancers.

**Follow-up complete (2/2):** National registries ensured near-complete follow-up; dropouts due to migration or loss to registry not reported as a major concern.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Possible migration-related loss noted, but no statistical method or adjustment for incomplete follow-up discussed.

**Statistical analysis appropriate (2/2):** Applied time-dependent Cox models, sensitivity analyses, and stratified cumulative incidence curves (Figure 1, p. 5).
