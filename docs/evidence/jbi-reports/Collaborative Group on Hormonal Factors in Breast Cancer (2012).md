# Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer (2012)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Explicit objective to evaluate the strength and variation in associations between age at menarche/menopause and breast cancer risk.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included epidemiological studies with ≥400 breast cancer cases and data on reproductive timing, excluding hormone therapy users.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Multi-pronged search including electronic databases (Medline, Embase, PubMed), correspondence, and collaborators’ meetings.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Included both published and unpublished data across 117 studies in 35 countries.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Excluded women with missing or unreliable exposure data and those who had used hormone therapy, to reduce bias.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Data harmonized centrally and stratified for consistency; principal investigators vetted classifications.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Central data checks, consistent coding, and standard analysis protocol ensured data integrity.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Conditional logistic regression and floating absolute risk models used for individual-level meta-analyses.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Inclusion of unpublished studies and consistency across design types helped minimize publication bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Findings support dose–response relationships between earlier menarche/later menopause and increased breast cancer risk, particularly for ER+ tumors.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Suggests need for further studies stratifying by receptor status, histology, and refining age at exposure measurement accuracy.

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer (2012) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Meta-analysis of individual-level data from 117 studies (n=118,964 cases, 306,091 controls). Rigorous subgroup and stratified analyses confirm strong associations between menarche/menopause timing and breast cancer, especially for ER+ and lobular tumors. All criteria clearly met. |
