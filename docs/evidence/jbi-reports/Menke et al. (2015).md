### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate to address target population (2/2):** NHANES sample represents the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

**Study participants sampled appropriately (2/2):** Stratified, multistage probability sampling used; described clearly in Methods.

**Sample size adequate (2/2):** Included 2,781 adults in 2011–2012 and over 23,000 in trend analyses; large enough for subgroup analysis.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Detailed demographic data (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education) provided.

**Sufficient coverage of identified sample (2/2):** High response rates (73–86%) for interviews and exams; national weighting used.

**Valid methods for condition identification (2/2):** Diabetes identified via A1c, FPG, and 2-hour PG per ADA standards.

**Standard, reliable measurement of condition (2/2):** Consistent lab protocols used across NHANES cycles; coefficients of variation reported.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Age-standardization, logistic regression, trend testing, and proper survey weights applied using SUDAAN.

**Confounding factors identified and accounted for (2/2):** Stratification and multivariable comparisons by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors.
