### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups comparable other than disease status (2/2):** Cases and controls were from the same cohort and matched on age, smoking, and date of blood draw.

**Cases and controls matched appropriately (2/2):** Matched 2:1 by age, smoking, and date of sample collection; women also matched by fasting status.

**Same criteria used for identification of cases and controls (2/2):** Cases were incident CHD events validated via medical records or death certificates; controls were free of CVD at the event date.

**Exposure measured in standard, valid and reliable way (2/2):** HbA1c measured via immunoinhibition method in CDC-certified labs with low CVs and long-term stability.

**Exposure measured the same for cases and controls (2/2):** Blinded lab analysis of HbA1c and CRP using stored plasma samples for both groups.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Controlled for age, smoking, alcohol, BMI, lipids, CRP, parental history, hormone use, physical activity.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Multivariable logistic regression with extensive adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and sensitivity analyses.

**Outcomes assessed in valid and reliable way (2/2):** MI and CHD adjudicated by blinded physicians using WHO/validated clinical criteria.

**Exposure period long enough to be meaningful (2/2):** HbA1c reflects glycemic control over months; participants followed 10â€“14 years, showing long-term predictive validity.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Conditional and unconditional logistic regression, spline modeling, regression dilution correction, and pooled analysis using random-effects meta-analysis.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pai et al. (2013) | JBI Checklist for Case Control Studies | 20/20 | 100% | Nested case-control within NHS and HPFS cohorts. HbA1c <6.5% associated with increased CHD risk. Biomarkers measured using validated lab protocols; exposure, outcome, and confounding handled rigorously. All appraisal criteria fully met. |
