# Sun et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Explicitly defined in abstract and introduction: to assess the dose-response relationship between BMI and bladder cancer risk.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Inclusion restricted to cohort studies reporting RRs/HRs for BMI and bladder cancer risk, excluding studies using SIRs or lacking proper data.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** PubMed and Web of Science searched through Sept 2014, with search terms and screening process clearly described (see flowchart on page 4).

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Two major databases plus reference screening used.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Only cohort studies with BMI exposure and bladder cancer outcome using RRs/HRs included; excluded poor-quality designs.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Explicitly stated that two reviewers independently screened studies and resolved discrepancies via discussion.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Dual extraction with predefined fields (e.g., effect size, adjustment variables, BMI method).

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects models used due to heterogeneity; dose-response meta-analysis applied using restricted cubic spline models.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Assessed using Egger’s and Begg’s tests; no evidence of publication bias (p = 0.712 and 0.912, respectively).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear recommendation that BMI is linearly associated with increased bladder cancer risk; consistent with findings.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Suggests more longitudinal studies to assess BMI fluctuation and clarify biological mechanisms.
