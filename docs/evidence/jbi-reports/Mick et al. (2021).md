### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were from the CLSA comprehensive cohort, sampled representatively from the Canadian population aged 45–85 using standardized criteria.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** CVD risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, smoking) were identified consistently using clinical/laboratory cutoffs or structured self-report.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Risk factors were defined using validated thresholds from Canadian clinical guidelines (e.g., HbA1c ≥6.5%, Framingham score).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Adjustments made for demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle variables, and site of data collection.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Multivariable regression and sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation were employed; age and sex stratifications also explored.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** The cohort excluded individuals with baseline hearing data missing or conditions interfering with testing; all had baseline PTA measurements.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Audiometric thresholds measured at 1000–4000 Hz using calibrated digital audiometers; outcome was bilateral PTA.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Follow-up spanned approximately 3 years; appropriate for detecting hearing changes.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** 27,765 of 30,097 had T1 data; reasons for attrition (death, withdrawal) detailed and analyzed for bias.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Compared characteristics of complete vs. incomplete data groups; used multiple imputation for sensitivity analysis.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Linear regression and mixed-effects models with survey weights; interactions tested for age and sex; robust standard errors used.
