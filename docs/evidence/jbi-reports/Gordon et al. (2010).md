# Gordon et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All patients were drawn from the same healthcare system, with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria to form comparable HCV-positive and HCV-negative cohorts.

**Exposures measured similarly for groups (2/2):** All participants were tested for anti-HCV and followed for RCC incidence using consistent procedures.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** HCV status confirmed via ELISA and HCV RNA molecular assays.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Key factors like age, race, gender, and CKD were explicitly addressed.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** Multivariate Cox regression models and stratified Kaplan-Meier analyses used.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** RCC cases diagnosed prior to baseline (1997) were excluded.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** RCC diagnosis verified via pathology reports or imaging, and confirmed by cancer registry abstractors.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Average follow-up was over 6 years, enough to detect RCC development.

**Follow-up complete, or differences described (2/2):** All participants had multiple encounters tracked; censored at death, RCC diagnosis, or last follow-up.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up utilized (2/2):** Follow-up strategies and censoring well-documented in survival analyses.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and sensitivity analyses excluding CKD patients employed.
