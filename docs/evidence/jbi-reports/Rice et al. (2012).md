# Rice et al. (2012)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** The objective to determine the association between gynecologic surgeries and ovarian cancer is clearly described in the abstract and introduction.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Studies included if they provided risk estimates for ovarian cancer related to tubal ligation or hysterectomy with p-values or 95% CIs.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase using relevant terms, plus reference and citation tracking.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Comprehensive database use and personal communications to supplement data.

**Appraisal criteria appropriate (0/2):** No formal quality assessment or critical appraisal of included studies was conducted or described.

**Independent critical appraisal (1/2):** Inclusion of studies was verified by a second reviewer, but this did not constitute a full critical appraisal process.

**Minimized extraction errors (2/2):** Data extracted and verified; standardization procedures appear sufficient.

**Combination of studies appropriate (2/2):** Used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects meta-analysis; heterogeneity and subgroup analyses conducted.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Begg’s and Egger’s tests applied; no evidence of publication bias found.

**Recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Conclusions generally reflect the findings, but policy/practice recommendations were not explicitly framed.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Identifies need for further study by tumor subtype and surgical characteristics.
