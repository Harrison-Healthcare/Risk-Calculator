# Liu et al. (2017)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The authors aimed to assess the association between oral contraceptive duration and risk of hypertension, including dose-response trends.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included observational studies (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional) with RR data on OC use and hypertension.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, CNKI) with broad inclusion of English and Chinese articles.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Comprehensive database strategy supported by manual reference checks ensured coverage.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** Although study characteristics were extracted, no formal risk-of-bias or quality appraisal framework (e.g., NOS scoring per study) was reported in the main text.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers (1/2):** Data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers, but appraisal (if done) was not explicitly indicated as being performed in duplicate.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Dual independent extraction with resolution by a third reviewer was applied, enhancing data reliability.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Inverse variance random-effects meta-analysis used with heterogeneity (I²), meta-regression, and dose-response modeling.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot and Egger's test were used; no small-study effects found (Egger p = .707).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Conclusions reflected consistent association across subgroups and a linear dose-response relationship of +13% RR per 5 years of use.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** The authors called for larger prospective studies, improved confounder control, and analysis by OC type and dose.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Liu et al. (2017) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Strong dose–response meta-analysis on oral contraceptive use and hypertension. Item 5 – no structured quality appraisal reported; Item 6 – dual reviewer extraction mentioned, but unclear if used for appraisal. |
