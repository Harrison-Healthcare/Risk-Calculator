# Zhu & Zhang (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Investigated the association between BMI and lung cancer risk among never smokers.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Defined by BMI exposure, outcome (lung cancer incidence or mortality), never smoker status, and observational design.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Extensive PubMed search with supplementary manual review; no language restrictions.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Included 29 studies totaling >10,000 cases in 15 million never smokers; both cohort and case-control designs.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Study quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with high-quality defined as ≥7/9.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Two independent investigators reviewed and extracted data, including quality scores.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Used a standardized data extraction protocol and verified data points from figures using digitizing software.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Applied random-effects models, dose-response trends, meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s test performed; trim-and-fill method applied where applicable.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Findings consistently supported inverse BMI-lung cancer association; explored confounding and biological plausibility.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Encourages mechanistic studies to explain observed associations and address unresolved questions about sex differences and causality.
