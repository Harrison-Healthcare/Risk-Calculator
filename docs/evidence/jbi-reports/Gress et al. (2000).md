### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Both hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups drawn from ARIC cohort using probability sampling from four U.S. communities.

**Exposures measured similarly (2/2):** Medication use verified by inspection of pill bottles and interviews at baseline.

**Valid and reliable exposure measurement (2/2):** Medication categories defined and assessed through structured methods including bottle inspection.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Adjustments for age, sex, race, BMI, education, lifestyle, comorbidities, and more were made.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Extensive multivariate models including proportional-hazards and logistic regression analyses used.

**Subjects free of outcome at start (2/2):** Participants with pre-existing diabetes excluded based on fasting/non-fasting glucose and medication history.

**Valid and reliable outcome measurement (2/2):** Incident diabetes defined using standard criteria including fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or medication use.

**Sufficient follow-up time (2/2):** Follow-up duration of 6 years with intermediate assessments at 3 years.

**Complete follow-up and loss described (1/2):** No detailed reporting on loss to follow-up rates; 948 participants excluded for missing follow-up data.

**Follow-up strategies described (1/2):** No explicit methods to maintain follow-up were discussed.

**Statistical analysis appropriate (2/2):** Used logistic regression and proportional hazards modeling adjusted for multiple confounders; stratified and interaction analyses also conducted.
