### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were from the Kaiser Permanente health system, aged 40â€“45 at baseline, forming a consistent and representative population-based cohort.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Obesity was measured using standardized procedures (BMI and skinfold thickness) at baseline for all participants.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Height, weight, and skinfold thickness were collected by trained personnel using validated anthropometric techniques.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Identified and adjusted for a wide range of demographic, behavioral, and medical comorbidities, including cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Used fully adjusted Cox proportional hazards models including variables such as age, sex, race, education, marital status, smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and cholesterol.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Only those dementia-free in mid-life were followed for incident dementia diagnoses starting in 1994.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Dementia diagnoses were obtained using standardized ICD-9 codes from electronic health records, applied consistently across the study period.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** The mean follow-up duration was 27 years, adequate for assessing the long-term incidence of dementia.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Attrition was addressed, with comparisons confirming no selection bias by mid-life adiposity or demographics between included and excluded participants.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Used post hoc analyses to evaluate potential bias; outcome ascertainment methods ensured near-complete dementia tracking among those retained.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox models with time-to-event data, multiple adjustment layers, and stratified analysis by sex and adiposity type were appropriately conducted.
