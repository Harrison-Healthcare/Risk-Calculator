### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate to address the target population (2/2):** NHANES represents the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population via multistage probability sampling.

**Study participants recruited appropriately (2/2):** Sample recruited across multiple NHANES cycles with consistent, validated protocols.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** 30,958 participants across seven NHANES cycles (1999â€“2012) included in BP analyses.

**Study subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbid characteristics described in depth by survey cycle.

**Data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage (2/2):** Stratified analyses by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and multivariable adjusted prevalence ratios were conducted using complex survey methods.

**Valid methods used for condition identification (2/2):** BP measured via three seated readings using mercury sphygmomanometers; prehypertension defined using JNC7 criteria.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** Standardized protocols for BP assessment and validated instruments ensured measurement reliability.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Logistic and Poisson regression, age adjustment using 2010 census data, and trend analysis over time were correctly applied.

**Response rate adequate, and if not, managed appropriately (2/2):** NHANES includes nonresponse weighting and data imputation strategies as part of its public-use dataset methodology.
