# Bagnardi et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim explicitly stated: to provide dose–response estimates between alcohol consumption and risk for 23 cancer types.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Only included observational studies reporting RRs/HRs or ORs with CIs across multiple exposure levels.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, and EMBASE through Sept 2012; keywords in Supplementary Material S1.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Three major databases plus manual reference searches were used.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Inclusion based on strict exposure/outcome criteria, requiring data for multiple alcohol levels.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Eligibility reviewed independently, with consensus for conflicts.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Detailed protocol for data harmonization and conversion of alcohol units to g/day; multiple risk estimates within studies combined appropriately.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects models used with log(RR) transformation, dose–response meta-regression applied.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Addressed in sensitivity analyses and discussed in relation to previous meta-analyses.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Concludes alcohol increases risk of several cancers even at low doses, supported by detailed subgroup and dose–response data.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Calls for further study on melanoma, prostate, and lymphoma cancers and stratified drinking patterns.
