# Ajani et al. (2006)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Inclusion criteria clearly defined (2/2):** Included adults aged ≥35 years across 24 U.S. states in the 2003 BRFSS cardiovascular module; exclusions clearly described (e.g., aspirin contraindications).

**Study subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Sample of 67,697 participants analyzed after exclusions; demographics, health status, and behavioral risk factors clearly described in Table 1 and discussion.

**Exposure measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Exposure was self-reported daily or alternate-day aspirin use, based on standardized BRFSS questions.

**Objective, standard criteria used for measurement (2/2):** Aspirin use defined as regular daily/every-other-day intake; CVD defined by prior physician diagnosis of MI, angina, or stroke.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age, gender, BMI, smoking, education, race/ethnicity, diabetes, and CVD status were considered and adjusted for in multivariable models (Table 1).

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** SUDAAN survey-weighted multivariate logistic regression adjusted for all relevant sociodemographic and clinical covariates.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Aspirin use for cardiovascular vs. analgesic reasons queried; participants without CVD or diabetes stratified by 0–4 CVD risk factors.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Weighted prevalence estimates, odds ratios, confidence intervals, and time-trend comparisons between 1999 and 2003 all accounted for design complexity.
