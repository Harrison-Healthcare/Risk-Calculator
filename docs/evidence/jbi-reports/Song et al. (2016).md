### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants drawn from the Kailuan cohort in Tangshan, China, using standardized inclusion criteria.

**Exposures measured similarly for groups (2/2):** Sleep duration self-reported through a consistent question across all participants.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Although self-reported, the sleep data categorization was methodically structured and clearly defined.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Included demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables like BMI, smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, and BP.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** Three-tiered Cox models with progressively adjusted covariates for robust confounder control.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Hypertension cases excluded at baseline based on BP readings and medication history.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** BP assessed by trained professionals using standardized protocols.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up of 3.98 years with regular BP assessments every two years.

**Follow-up complete, or differences described (2/2):** Exclusions clearly described (e.g., prior hypertension, missing sleep data, no follow-up visits).

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up utilized (1/2):** No sensitivity analyses or imputation strategies were described for potential attrition effects.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards modeling with interactions tested for age and gender effects.
