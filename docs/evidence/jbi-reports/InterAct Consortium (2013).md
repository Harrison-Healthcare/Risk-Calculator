# InterAct Consortium (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Drawn from a representative subcohort of the EPIC study across eight European countries, all free of diabetes at baseline.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Family history of diabetes was collected using harmonized questionnaires across countries and analyzed uniformly as any first-degree relative or by specific family member type.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Exposure classification relied on detailed questionnaire-based data, with further categorization by age at diagnosis and relation (e.g., maternal vs. paternal) to enhance validity.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** BMI, waist/hip circumference, physical activity, diet, education, smoking, and genetic risk score were explicitly identified and examined as potential mediators or confounders.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Adjusted Cox models and mediation analyses accounted for potential confounding by each risk factor separately and in combination (Figure 2, p. 6).

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Participants with known diabetes were excluded at baseline; all cases were incident and verified via medical records or registries.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident type 2 diabetes was verified via national registries and confirmed by at least two independent sources or medical review.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up time was extensive (up to 9 years) with 3.99 million person-years accumulated across 340,000 participants.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Loss to follow-up was minimal, and all incident cases were confirmed through validated methods across countries; nonresponse bias was examined.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Used Prentice-weighted Cox models and sensitivity analyses to address missingness and ensure robust inference.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Applied country-specific Cox models with random-effects meta-analysis, mediation modeling, and stratified subgroup and interaction analyses (e.g., genetic score Ã— family history).
