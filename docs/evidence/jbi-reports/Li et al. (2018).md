# Li et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** Investigates the correlation between sleep duration and hypertension risk using dose-response analysis.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included prospective cohort studies with baseline normotension and RR/CI for hypertension risk by sleep duration.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and manual sources up to Dec 2017.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** Three major databases were searched plus manual methods; search terms well-described.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (2/2):** Quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) with clear scoring threshold (≥7 for high quality).

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (2/2):** Independent review and conflict resolution process described.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Standardized forms used for extracting study characteristics, outcomes, and confounders.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Dose-response meta-analysis using restricted cubic spline models; heterogeneity assessed (I², Q-test).

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Egger’s test showed no publication bias (P = 0.9766).

**Recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Conclusions align with results, but limited discussion on how potential bias in primary studies may affect findings.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Notes instability in sensitivity analysis and calls for more high-quality studies.
