### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** All participants were Kaiser Permanente members aged 50–60 who took part in a standardized health exam (Multiphasic Health Checkup) from 1978–1985.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Smoking exposure was categorized consistently across all participants via a detailed questionnaire administered during the baseline exam.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Smoking data included pack/day categories; responses were collected during in-person health interviews as part of routine care, minimizing misclassification.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Numerous sociodemographic, cardiovascular, and lifestyle variables were identified, including BMI, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, education, and alcohol use.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Fully adjusted Cox models included all relevant covariates. Sensitivity analyses stratified by stroke status confirmed robustness of associations.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** All participants were free of diagnosed dementia at baseline (midlife, 1978–1985); follow-up for dementia began only in 1994.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Dementia diagnoses were obtained via clinical electronic records, using ICD-9-CM codes from neurologist and neuropsychologist assessments.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up time was 23 years, sufficient to observe late-life dementia outcomes.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Follow-up included censoring for death or loss of health plan membership; attrition managed via time-to-event analyses.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Used Cox models with age as the time scale; sensitivity analyses accounted for stroke as an intercurrent condition.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and stratified analyses by stroke status were appropriately used.
