### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The study aimed to quantify the association between sedentary behaviour and anxiety, and whether the relationship is moderated by population or methodological characteristics.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Clear inclusion/exclusion criteria focused on observational studies measuring sedentary behaviour (e.g., sitting, screen time) and anxiety symptoms/disorders.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** The search covered eight databases with a detailed strategy provided (Supplementary File S1), including keywords and Boolean operators.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** A broad range of databases were searched (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, etc.), and manual searches were conducted.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Study quality was assessed using the AXIS tool, a validated 20-item appraisal tool for observational studies.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers (2/2):** Two researchers independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and scored risk of bias; disagreements were resolved via discussion.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Dual data extraction was applied, including contact with authors to verify missing data.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis with inverse-variance weighting was applied; heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots, Begg’s rank correlation, and Duval & Tweedie’s trim and fill method were used to check for publication bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** The conclusions were clearly based on multivariable-adjusted estimates and highlighted moderation findings (e.g., sitting time vs. screen time).

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Authors recommended future observational and experimental research using objective sedentary behaviour measures in clinical anxiety populations.
