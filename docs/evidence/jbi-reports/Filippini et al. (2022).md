# Filippini et al. (2022)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** Explicit aim to examine the dose–response relationship between sodium intake and hypertension incidence in cohort studies.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Well-specified PECO criteria covering cohort design, sodium exposure, and hypertension incidence.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to January 2022, including backward/forward citation tracking.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** Included multiple major databases with no language restriction.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (0/2):** While the ROBINS-E tool was used, specific appraisal criteria were not clearly defined within the paper or supplemental tables.

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (2/2):** Data screening and quality assessment were performed independently by two authors with arbitration by a third.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Detailed approach for extraction of exposure data, hypertension outcomes, and risk estimates.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Dose–response meta-analysis using restricted cubic splines and random-effects model.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Egger’s test and funnel plot used; no evidence of bias detected.

**Recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Recommendations align with results, but discussion of potential bias impact (e.g., measurement error) is limited to the discussion rather than systematically integrated.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Suggestions include improving sodium measurement methods and exploring sex-specific analyses.
