### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants were male health professionals enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS); exclusions were consistently applied.

**Exposure measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** Ejaculation frequency assessed via identical self-administered questionnaire at 3 adult life stages.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** While retrospective recall introduces potential measurement error, anonymous reporting via a validated questionnaire mitigated bias, and exposure was captured prospectively.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Identified race, BMI, diet, PSA screening, vasectomy, and more, known to influence prostate cancer risk.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox models adjusted for >15 confounders across behavioral, dietary, and medical domains; missing data handled via robust imputation strategy.

**Groups free of outcome at start (2/2):** Men with prior cancer diagnoses were excluded from the analysis to ensure baseline outcome-free cohort.

**Outcomes measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Incident prostate cancer diagnoses confirmed via medical records and pathology reports; stage and grade used NCCN classification.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Participants were followed from 1992 to 2010 (18 years), with 3839 prostate cancer cases identified during 480,831 person-years.

**Follow-up complete (2/2):** Among those alive in 2010, follow-up was 96% complete; additional outcomes captured via National Death Index.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Competing risk models, exclusion of early cases, and analyses of missing data using multiple strategies support a high standard of methodological rigor.

**Statistical analysis appropriate (2/2):** Applied time-updated multivariate Cox models, competing risks framework, Kaplan-Meier curves, sensitivity and stratified analysesâ€”all appropriately interpreted.
