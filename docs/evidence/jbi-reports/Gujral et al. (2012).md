# Gujral et al. (2012)

### Item-by-Item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The objective to review prevalence, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of celiac disease is stated upfront in the abstract and introduction.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** While not formally structured, the review broadly includes studies addressing CD epidemiology and pathophysiology across populations, aligning with the review aims.

**Search strategy appropriate (0/2):** There is no mention of specific databases searched, search terms, or timeframes – a key omission for reproducibility.

**Sources and resources adequate (1/2):** The review references a wide array of global studies, but without detailing the selection method or ensuring comprehensive capture.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal critical appraisal of included studies was described.

**Critical appraisal conducted by ≥2 reviewers independently (1/2):** Not stated; assumed single-author synthesis.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (1/2):** No methods described, though data presented are consistent.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Narrative synthesis is acceptable given the heterogeneity of the data.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (0/2):** No discussion or methods to evaluate publication bias.

**Recommendations supported by reported data (1/2):** Recommendations are consistent with general findings but not rigorously justified or weighed against bias.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** The authors highlight the need for future treatment options beyond a gluten-free diet.

| Gujral et al. (2012) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 15/22       | 68.2%                | Broad overview synthesizing global data on celiac disease; lacks methodological transparency typical of systematic reviews. Item 3 – search strategy unclear; Item 5 – no appraisal criteria; Item 6 – unclear if critical appraisal done independently; Item 9 – publication bias not assessed; Item 10 – recommendations not clearly grounded in reviewed data. |
