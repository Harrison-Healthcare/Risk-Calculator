# Peters et al. (2014)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly aimed to compare sex-specific associations between diabetes and incident coronary heart disease (CHD).

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included prospective population-based cohort studies reporting sex-specific relative risks for CHD with diabetes.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Searched PubMed from 1966 to February 2013 using combined text and MeSH terms. Also screened references and included unpublished cohort data.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Sourced data from 64 cohorts across North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific region, with both published and IPD sources.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Studies had to report adjusted relative risks and sex-specific data; inclusion/exclusion was well documented (e.g., Fig. 1).

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Data extraction and inclusion decisions confirmed by all three authors with consensus.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized extraction with validation from four major cohort datasets (e.g., ARIC, NHANES III).

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Pooled relative risks (RRs) and women-to-men RR ratios (RRR) using random-effects meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot and trim-and-fill methods used; minimal evidence of publication bias observed (Fig. ESM 2).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Diabetes associated with RR = 2.82 in women and RR = 2.16 in men for CHD; women had a 44% greater risk than men (RRR = 1.44 [95% CI: 1.27â€“1.63]).

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Authors recommend investigating mechanisms of sex disparity, including metabolic deterioration and prediabetic risk profiles.
