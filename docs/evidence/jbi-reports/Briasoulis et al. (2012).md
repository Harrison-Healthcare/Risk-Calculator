# Briasoulis et al. (2012)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Assessed the dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension risk separately for men and women.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included only prospective studies with ≥3 alcohol consumption levels and ≥1-year follow-up, clearly defined outcomes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search in MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library plus manual reference screening.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Search strategy spanned four major databases and relevant reviews, covering 1990–2012.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal critical appraisal tool or quality scoring framework was applied to included studies.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers (1/2):** Data extraction was done independently by two authors, but formal quality appraisal was not conducted.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Used independent dual extraction with arbitration to resolve disagreements.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects model applied; dose-stratified analysis and relative risks computed by gender.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s tests were used to assess small-study effects; no bias detected.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Dose-response results presented clearly with visual and statistical interpretation consistent with conclusions.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Called for future research on sex differences, beverage type, drinking patterns, and confounding.
