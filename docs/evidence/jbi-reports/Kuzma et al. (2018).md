# Kuzma et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Explicit objective to assess stroke (prevalent or incident) as a risk factor for all-cause dementia.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included only prospective studies in adults aged ≥18 comparing stroke vs. no-stroke groups with incident dementia as the outcome.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, backward/forward citation tracking, and contacting authors for additional data.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Three major databases searched using detailed strategy; supplemented by citation chaining and author contact.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Used the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies with multiple domains rated independently.

**Critical appraisal by ≥2 reviewers independently (2/2):** Dual-reviewer screening, data extraction, and bias assessment with a third reviewer resolving conflicts.

**Methods to minimize data extraction error (2/2):** Structured, independently conducted extraction with cross-checking.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Separate random-effects meta-analyses by stroke type; inverse variance method used with I², PIs, and sensitivity analyses.

**Assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Visual funnel plots and Egger’s test; no bias detected in key analyses.

**Recommendations for policy/practice supported by data (2/2):** Concluded stroke is a modifiable dementia risk factor, supporting integration into prevention frameworks.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Called for better reporting of stroke timing, education/ethnicity effects, and neuroimaging biomarkers.

| Kuźma et al. (2018) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 22/22 | 100% | Rigorous and comprehensive meta-analysis of 46 prospective cohort studies quantifying the relationship between stroke and dementia. Extensive bias assessments, dual-reviewer processes, and robust subgroup/meta-regression analyses satisfy all methodological criteria. |
