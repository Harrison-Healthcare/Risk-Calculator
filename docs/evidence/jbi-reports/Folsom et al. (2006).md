# Folsom et al. (2006)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants aged 45–74 from four U.S. communities, free of CHD/stroke at baseline, with consistent eligibility criteria.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Biomarkers assessed in stored samples using standardized assays; traditional risk factors collected via validated protocols at baseline.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Lab assays for CRP, IL-6, LpPLA2, vitamin B6, and others were reproducible (reliability coefficients up to 0.81).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Major CHD risk factors included in base models: age, sex, race, BP, lipids, smoking, diabetes.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Cox models adjusted for traditional risk factors; bootstrapped ROC comparison used to assess incremental prediction.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Incident CHD cases only included; participants with baseline MI, stroke, or TIA were excluded.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** CHD events confirmed via hospital/death record linkage and adjudicated using standard protocols.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up ranged 3–7.3 years across biomarker substudies; sufficient to detect CHD outcomes.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Full follow-up for CHD via registry linkage; completeness implied but not explicitly quantified.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No detailed discussion of handling missing biomarker data or attrition effects in nested subcohorts.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression with weighted ROC analysis, bootstrapped AUC comparisons, and multiple subgroup analyses.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Folsom et al. (2006) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | ARIC cohort study (n = 15,792) evaluated whether novel biomarkers enhance CHD risk prediction beyond traditional factors. Despite strong associations for some markers (e.g., CRP, IL-6), AUC improvements were minimal. Item 10 – no explicit strategy for handling missing data or follow-up attrition reported. |
