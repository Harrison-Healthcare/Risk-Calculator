### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants were recruited from the UK Biobank cohort, a large, nationally representative prospective study.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Baseline diet assessed using a standardized touchscreen questionnaire; in a subset, repeated 24-h recalls were used to reduce random error.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Intake frequency was converted to estimated grams/day using repeat 24-h recalls, minimizing measurement error.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Extensive list included sociodemographic variables, lifestyle, diet, reproductive factors, and BMI.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Used multivariable Cox models (Models 0–3), incrementally adjusting for demographics, diet, and BMI.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Participants with prior diagnoses of each outcome were excluded from respective analyses.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Outcomes ascertained through linkage to hospital admission and mortality records using ICD-10 codes.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Average follow-up was 8.0 years, allowing adequate time for incidence detection across conditions.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Participants were linked to national health databases with minimal attrition; losses not explicitly quantified but assumed minimal.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Did not describe specific handling of missing data or attrition in sensitivity analyses beyond BMI and smoking stratification.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Used Cox proportional hazards models with Bonferroni correction, sensitivity analyses, and stratified modeling.

| Papier et al. (2021) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | Outcome-wide cohort analysis in 474,985 UK adults followed ~8 years. Associations between meat intake and 25 common diseases examined. Rigorous adjustment for confounders and repeated dietary assessment. Item 10 – no specific strategy for handling potential loss to follow-up or missing longitudinal data reported. |
