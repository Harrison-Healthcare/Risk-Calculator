# Clague et al. (2009)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear and explicit review question (2/2):** The study explicitly aimed to assess the association between family history of kidney cancer and risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using three analytic approaches.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Inclusion criteria included case-control and cohort studies reporting RCC risk by family history with calculable effect estimates.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search of PubMed from 1950 to April 2008 using expanded keyword criteria; also included citation reviews.

**Sources and databases adequate (2/2):** PubMed and cited reference lists were used; while additional databases would be ideal, the coverage is acceptable.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (1/2):** Inclusion/exclusion criteria were detailed, but there is no mention of a formal appraisal tool like NOS or GRADE.

**Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers (2/2):** Study selection and data extraction were described as systematic, though reviewer independence was not clearly defined, it is implied through structured protocol.

**Methods for data extraction described (2/2):** Clear extraction protocol including study characteristics, population, design, and adjusted estimates.

**Data synthesis appropriate (2/2):** Meta-analysis used random-effects model with subgroup and heterogeneity analyses; RRs/ORs/SIRs treated equivalently given low RCC incidence.

**Appropriate assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Funnel plot and Egger's and Begg's tests used; no publication bias detected (P = 0.174 and 0.188).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Meta-analytic results consistently support the association, with effect size interpretation and implications discussed across subgroups.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Highlights need to examine low-penetrance genetic factors and improve stratification by family history type.
