### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** The study used a case-cohort design nested within the ARIC population cohort of 10,275 adults without baseline diabetes .

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Adiponectin levels were measured in baseline plasma samples using the same validated radioimmunoassay across all participants.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Adiponectin was measured in duplicate with a high reliability coefficient (0.95), using stored plasma samples analyzed under consistent lab conditions.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** The study adjusted for a comprehensive list of confounders including age, sex, race, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting glucose and insulin, inflammation markers, smoking status, and parental history of diabetes.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Used multivariable proportional hazards models with sequential adjustment models to isolate the independent effect of adiponectin.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Participants with prevalent diabetes were excluded from the analysis, and incident cases were clearly defined based on glucose thresholds, diagnosis, or treatment.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident diabetes was defined using fasting/non-fasting glucose, medication use, or physician diagnosis—standard clinical criteria.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was ~9 years for non-cases and ~3 years for cases—adequate to observe new onset diabetes.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** A well-documented sampling and exclusion process was described, with clear rationale for participant exclusion at baseline.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** The case-cohort design allowed efficient use of data with survey-weighted modeling to correct for sampling fractions.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Used proportional hazards models with SUDAAN for case-cohort design, interaction tests, and stratified analyses by smoking, inflammation, sex, and ethnicity (see Figures 1 & 2, p. 2475–2476).
