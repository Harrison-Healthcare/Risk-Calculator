### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Appropriate sample frame (2/2):** The CCDSS covers ~97% of the Canadian population via provincial and territorial health insurance registries.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** All eligible individuals aged ≥1 year with health coverage are included—essentially a census approach.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** Over 3 million diagnosed diabetes cases captured, ensuring statistical power.

**Detailed description of subjects and setting (2/2):** The study provides demographic breakdowns by age, sex, province, and diagnostic codes.

**Sufficient coverage in data analysis (2/2):** Crude and age-standardized rates were calculated using complete provincial/territorial data (with noted exclusions).

**Valid methods for identifying condition (2/2):** A standardized algorithm using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for diabetes diagnosis across datasets.

**Standard and reliable measurement (2/2):** Case definitions and methods are uniformly applied across jurisdictions using validated algorithms.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Use of Joinpoint regression and age standardization to assess trends and account for population structure.

**Adequate response rate and management (1/2):** The study acknowledges underestimation due to undiagnosed/subclinical diabetes but does not quantify or adjust for it; no direct response rate is applicable.
