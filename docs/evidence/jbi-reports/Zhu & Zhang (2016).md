# Zhu & Zhang (2016)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):**  
The review examined global prevalence estimates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and its progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):**  
Included studies published between 2005 and 2015 with data on GDM prevalence or T2DM progression, excluding those with unclear diagnostic criteria or low-quality scores.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):**  
Conducted in PubMed with well-defined MeSH and text word combinations; 3357 articles were initially identified, and 77 qualified for synthesis after two-stage screening.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):**  
Used PubMed and reference cross-checking without language restriction. Inclusion of developing and developed country data sources provided global perspective.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):**  
Used a structured quality scoring system based on sampling, data source, GDM ascertainment method, and recency of study year, developed by the IDF.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):**  
Study screening and data extraction were done in phases by at least two investigators, with criteria for inclusion/exclusion well defined.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):**  
Full-text screening and duplicate removal procedures were described; median values used for country and regional estimates ensured data consistency.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):**  
Median estimates were used for regional prevalence, stratified by WHO region and diagnostic criteria; dose-response for progression to T2DM discussed with relative risk (RR) data from 27 cohort studies.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):**  
While no formal funnel plot or Egger’s test was presented, selective inclusion based on study quality scores (≥4) and exclusion of low-rigor studies minimized bias risk.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):**  
Emphasized the need for standardized screening, data collection, and targeted prevention given global GDM and T2DM trends, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):**  
Called for collaborative surveillance studies, harmonization of diagnostic criteria, and longitudinal tracking of GDM progression globally.
