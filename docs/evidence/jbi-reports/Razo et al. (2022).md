# Razo et al. (2022)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clearly stated review question (2/2):** Objective explicitly defined—to assess the continuous relationship between SBP and IHD using a burden of proof approach.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Eligibility criteria included SBP values, outcome measures (IHD), and study types (RCTs/cohort); described in detail in methods and PRISMA flow diagram.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** PRISMA-compliant systematic review using prior meta-analyses and a new literature search through April 2020; PubMed strategies detailed in Supplementary Info.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Built on Salam et al. (2019), identified 2,368 RCTs, screened full texts, and supplemented with Global Burden of Disease cohort sources.

**Criteria for appraising studies (2/2):** Applied a bias covariate selection algorithm to test for systematic and reporting biases using Egger's test and covariate adjustments.

**Critical appraisal conducted (2/2):** Used rigorous selection and appraisal processes including visual (funnel plots) and statistical bias diagnostics.

**Minimizing errors in appraisal (2/2):** Dual independent review and trimming of outliers via robust likelihood-based methods ensured reliable selection.

**Appropriate methods for data synthesis (2/2):** Used Bayesian regularized spline meta-regression and random effects modeling; generated BPRF and ROS star ratings.

**Assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Assessed via funnel plots and Egger’s test; potential bias noted but deemed minor.

**Support for policy/practice recommendations (2/2):** Discussed public health implications, including treatment thresholds, hypertension control strategies, and prevention policies.

**Appropriate directives for new research (2/2):** Identified research gaps, especially data scarcity at extreme SBP levels and the need for disaggregated analyses.

| Razo et al. (2022) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Comprehensive review of 41 studies (39 RCTs + 2 cohort studies; N = 1.5 million) quantifying the SBP-IHD dose–response relationship using advanced Bayesian meta-regression. Rigorous methods, bias adjustment, heterogeneity modeling, and star rating of evidence strength were all thoroughly addressed. All appraisal items met. |
