### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** NHANES uses a stratified, multistage probability cluster sample of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** Sampling follows a nationally representative protocol with weighting to adjust for design, nonresponse, and noncoverage.

**Adequate sample size (1/2):** No explicit sample size justification provided, although the large sample (n=5926) likely offers adequate power.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Participants' demographics, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity, are clearly detailed.

**Sufficient coverage of sample in analysis (2/2):** Sampling weights and design effects were accounted for in statistical analysis.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (2/2):** Obesity defined using BMI ≥30 based on measured weight and height using standardized methods.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** Anthropometric measures conducted by trained personnel with standardized equipment.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Use of SUDAAN for complex survey analysis, adjustment for age and survey design.

**Adequate response rate (1/2):** Response rate not explicitly discussed for 2009–2010 NHANES cycle.

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flegal et al. (2012) | JBI Checklist for Prevalence Studies | 17/18 | 94.4% | High quality national surveillance data using NHANES, with rigorous sampling and measurement protocols. Item 3 – sample size not explicitly justified in the article; Item 9 – response rate not discussed, although NHANES typically ensures high compliance. |
