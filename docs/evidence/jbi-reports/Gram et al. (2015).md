# Gram et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** All women were part of the Multiethnic Cohort, aged 45–75, residing in California or Hawaii, with comparable baseline characteristics across groups.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Smoking exposure variables derived from standardized self-administered baseline questionnaires.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Measures such as age at initiation, duration, cigarettes/day, and pack-years were validated in prior MEC analyses.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** The study adjusted for race/ethnicity, BMI, family history, education, alcohol, age at menarche, parity, menopausal status, and hormone use.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox models controlled for a comprehensive set of a priori defined confounders.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Women with prior breast cancer were excluded at baseline.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Incident breast cancers identified via linkage to SEER registries, with complete case ascertainment through 2010.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up was 14.6 years, with over 1.3 million person-years accumulated.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Migration outside registry areas was low (<5%), and vital status ascertainment was near-complete.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No formal discussion of handling missing data or censoring due to loss to follow-up.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox models with stratified subgroup and trend analyses, including for non-drinkers and parity-timing interactions.

| Gram et al. (2015) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | Large, ethnically diverse cohort with long follow-up and detailed exposure assessment. Item 10 – follow-up assumed complete but missing explicit strategies for handling loss-to-follow-up or missing data. |
