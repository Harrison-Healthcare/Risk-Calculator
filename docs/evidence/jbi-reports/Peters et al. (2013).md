| Peters et al. (2013) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 18/22 | 81.8% | Generally high quality meta-analysis, with clear review question, inclusion criteria, and synthesis methods; however, appraisal criteria and independent critical appraisal by multiple reviewers were not described.
