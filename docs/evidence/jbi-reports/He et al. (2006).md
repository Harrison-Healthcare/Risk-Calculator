# He et al. (2006)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim was to quantify the association between fruit and vegetable intake and stroke risk.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Limited to prospective cohort studies reporting relative risks/hazard ratios by intake categories.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and bibliographies with detailed terms.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Multiple databases and reference checks were used.

**Criteria for appraising studies (2/2):** Only studies with specific outcome and exposure measures were included; criteria for quality indirectly embedded in strict inclusion filters.

**Independent appraisal by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Data extraction performed by two authors with resolution by a third reviewer.

**Methods to minimize errors in extraction (2/2):** Differences resolved through discussion with third author.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used fixed and random-effects models; addressed heterogeneity and subgroup analysis.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s regression test used; no significant asymmetry found.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Advocated for >5 servings/day based on pooled RR findings.

**Specific directives for future research (2/2):** Called for research into differential effects by fruit/vegetable type.
