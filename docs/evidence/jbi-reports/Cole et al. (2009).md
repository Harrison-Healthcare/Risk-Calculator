# Cole et al. (2009)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim to quantify aspirin’s effect on recurrence of colorectal adenomas and advanced lesions in high-risk populations.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included only double-blind RCTs with colonoscopy-confirmed baseline clearance and follow-up; excluded FAP patients.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Searched Medline, Web of Science, and contacted investigators for unpublished data.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Four RCTs identified and included, comprising data from U.S., UK, France, and multinational trials.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Trials included if they had complete colonoscopy data, IRB approval, and follow-up of at least one year.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers (2/2):** Patient-level data centrally obtained, cleaned, and uniformly reanalyzed by blinded researchers.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized, individual-level data collected across studies; adjusted for compliance and follow-up quality.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis with trial-specific and pooled RR and ARR estimates; forest plots used.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** All known eligible trials included; results consistent across sensitivity analyses and subgroups.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Statistically significant 17% RR reduction in adenoma risk and 28% in advanced lesions; clearly reported with contextual interpretation.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Advocated for longer-term follow-up, clearer dose–response studies, and integrated risk–benefit assessments in cancer prevention strategies.

| Cole et al. (2009) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Patient-level meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (n=2967) evaluating aspirin for secondary prevention of colorectal adenomas. Strong design, subgroup/time analysis, and risk/benefit contextualization. All items clearly met. |
