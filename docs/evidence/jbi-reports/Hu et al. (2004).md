# Hu et al. (2004)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Men and women aged 25-64 from four regions in Finland, selected randomly and screened for eligibility.

**Exposures measured similarly for groups (2/2):** Uniform criteria for categorizing physical activity and BMI applied to all participants.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Self-reported physical activity was previously validated; BMI was derived from measured height/weight.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** The study acknowledged key confounders such as smoking, alcohol use, and baseline blood pressure.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** Adjusted hazard ratios using multivariable Cox regression models.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Excluded those with previous hypertension treatment, CHD, stroke, or heart failure.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident hypertension determined via a national drug reimbursement register.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up duration of 11 years is adequate for detecting incident hypertension.

**Follow-up complete, or differences described (1/2):** Loss to follow-up not explicitly quantified; assumption based on registry linkage.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up utilized (1/2):** Minimal discussion of attrition or methods to handle missing data.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox proportional hazards models with appropriate covariate adjustments.
