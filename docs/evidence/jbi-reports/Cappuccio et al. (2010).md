# Cappuccio et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clear aim to quantify the risk of type 2 diabetes associated with sleep quantity and quality.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Only prospective cohort studies with ≥3 years’ follow-up and incident diabetes outcomes were included.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Used MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and manual searches without language restriction.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Comprehensive databases used, and 1,553 articles screened for relevance.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** While study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black Index, this was not used to guide inclusion/exclusion or sensitivity weighting.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers independently (1/2):** Data extracted independently by two reviewers; unclear if quality appraisal was also independently conducted.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Dual review and consensus processes described for data extraction.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects models, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses applied; heterogeneity assessed.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Assessed using Egger’s regression and funnel plots for each sleep parameter; trim-and-fill also applied.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Well-supported findings.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Recommends further studies using objective sleep measures and diverse global samples.

| Cappuccio et al. (2010) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Well-conducted meta-analysis with strong synthesis of global evidence linking sleep disturbances to type 2 diabetes. Item 5 – no formal appraisal criteria; Item 6 – unclear if appraisal was independent. |
