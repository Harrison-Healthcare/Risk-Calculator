# Prescott et al. (1998)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants drawn from three coordinated Danish population studies; exclusions applied uniformly (e.g., prior MI, incomplete data).

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Smoking behavior recorded at baseline via standardized questionnaire with six tobacco use categories.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Smoking quantified by type, amount, inhalation, and pack-years; categories were clear and cross-validated by prior studies.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Risk factors included age, BP, BMI, lipids, alcohol, diabetes, physical activity, education.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Adjusted Cox models controlled for all major cardiovascular risk factors and stratified by sex.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Participants with prior MI were excluded, ensuring outcomes represented incident cases.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Myocardial infarction identified through national hospitalization and death registries using ICD-8 code 410.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up of 12.3 years, with 1763 MIs recorded; endpoint captures both fatal and non-fatal events.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Only one subject lost; registry linkage provided near-complete follow-up for outcomes.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** While loss was minimal, the study lacks discussion of potential data incompleteness or time-varying exposure changes.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression models with age as timescale, stratified by sex, adjusted for multiple covariates; interaction tests performed.

| Prescott et al. (1998) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | Large prospective study of 24,663 Danish adults followed for 12.3 years. Clear exposure/outcome definitions, with sex-stratified analysis showing greater MI risk in female smokers. Item 10 â€“ no detailed discussion of handling incomplete follow-up or data loss. |
