# Vestergaard (2005)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Focused on assessing whether epilepsy increases fracture risk across skeletal sites.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Defined inclusion for observational studies comparing fracture risk in people with vs. without epilepsy.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched PubMed, EMBASE, Springer Link, Ovid with comprehensive search terms and no language restriction stated.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** 11 studies included; multiple fracture types assessed with subgroup stratification (hip, forearm, spine).

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Study quality assessed using a structured scoring table (Table S1, p. 7) covering selection, comparability, and exposure.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** While quality assessment was done, independent dual appraisal was not clearly described.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Data extracted via group review and standardized criteria; sensitivity analysis confirms result stability (Fig. 3, p. 4).

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model with I² for heterogeneity assessment.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots (Fig. 4, p. 4) and Begg’s test (p = 0.662) indicated no bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Found strong evidence of increased fracture risk (RR = 1.97 overall), with differential risks by site and seizure characteristics.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Calls for studies on seizure types, AED use, and BMD management to refine fracture prevention strategies.
