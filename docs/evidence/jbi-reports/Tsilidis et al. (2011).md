# Tsilidis et al. (2011)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants from the EPIC cohort; cases and controls nested within same population.

**Exposures measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** 25(OH)D levels measured using standardized assay methods across all centers.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Vitamin D measured via chemiluminescence immunoassay with internal quality control; reproducibility validated.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Identified age, sex, BMI, smoking, physical activity, education, calcium intake, and seasonality.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors stated (2/2):** All models adjusted for identified confounders; additional sensitivity analyses conducted.

**Participants free of outcome at start of study (2/2):** All cancer cases were incident; cohort follow-up ensured pre-diagnosis baseline exposure.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Colorectal cancer verified by registries or active follow-up; ICD-10 coding used uniformly.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was 3.8 years; ranged from 1.8–8.7 years, adequate for outcome onset.

**Follow-up complete and reasons for loss described (2/2):** Full case ascertainment through cancer registries or follow-up systems; minimal loss reported.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (0/2):** No methods explicitly described to mitigate or model incomplete follow-up.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Conditional logistic regression with stratification and mutual adjustment across vitamin D quintiles; heterogeneity tested.

| Tsilidis et al. (2011) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 20/22 | 90.9% | High-quality analysis of 477,312 participants from 10 European cohorts on vitamin D and colorectal cancer; clear exposure and outcome assessment, extensive confounder adjustment, and complete follow-up; Item 10 – no explicit strategies for incomplete follow-up described. |
