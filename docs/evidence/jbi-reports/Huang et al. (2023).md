# Huang et al. (2023)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Clear review question (2/2):** The study aimed to evaluate the quality of evidence and biases in studies linking dietary sugar intake with health outcomes—clearly stated in abstract and methods.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Inclusion/exclusion criteria were specified for systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on sugar types, population health status, and study design.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Multiple databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane) searched; terms described, PRISMA flowchart provided (Fig 1, page 3).

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** At least four major databases plus hand-searching of references used.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (0/2):** No appraisal of individual included meta-analyses beyond AMSTAR score extraction; no use of standardized tool for evaluating primary studies within meta-analyses.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Two reviewers (YH and ZYC) assessed study quality and extracted data independently.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Discrepancies resolved by third reviewer (LRL); Cohen’s kappa used to assess inter-rater agreement (κ = 0.906).

**Appropriate methods to combine studies (2/2):** Re-analysis conducted using random/fixed effects; heterogeneity and small study effects considered; reanalyzed risk ratios, ORs, WMDs, etc.

**Assessment of publication bias (2/2):** Egger’s test and funnel plots used where ≥10 studies were included; publication bias discussed in results.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Recommendations for sugar reduction and policy supported by synthesized evidence and WHO/WCRF guidelines.

**Appropriate directives for future research (2/2):** Authors highlighted the need for more high-quality RCTs and site-specific cancer research.

| Huang et al. (2023) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 20/22 | 90.9% | Large, well-structured umbrella review of 73 meta-analyses; search strategy, inclusion criteria, and heterogeneity/publication bias addressed. Item 5 – no specific critical appraisal of included studies; Item 10 – did not explicitly discuss the impact of bias on findings. |
