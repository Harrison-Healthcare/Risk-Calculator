# Stratton et al. (1998)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Aimed to estimate relative and lifetime risk of ovarian cancer based on categories of family history.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included all cohort and case-control studies reporting family history and ovarian cancer risk.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Used Medline (1966–1997) and hand searching; comprehensive keyword-based strategy described.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Included 16 studies (13 case-control, 3 cohort); results stratified by relation type, age, and number of affected relatives.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal risk of bias or quality appraisal tool was applied to included studies.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently (1/2):** Screening and selection methods described, but no statement that appraisal or exclusion decisions were independently verified.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Data harmonized; adjusted risk estimates preferred where available; heterogeneity addressed and documented.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Mantel-Haenszel method for case-control studies, inverse variance meta-analysis for pooled estimates.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** While not formally tested, heterogeneity analysis and study exclusion criteria aimed to minimize bias (e.g., excluding overlapping datasets).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Risk estimates stratified by family member and age are well-supported and applied to SEER-derived lifetime risk calculations (Figures 2–5, pp. 4–6).

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Authors call for population-based studies of BRCA1/2 carriers and highlight implications for genetic counseling and surgical decision-making.
