# Zhong et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Clearly stated objective to evaluate the association between smoking and risk of dementia and explore effect modifiers.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Included only prospective cohort studies with dementia-free individuals at baseline and relevant risk estimates.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Comprehensive search across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Psychinfo; terms included a wide range of smoking and dementia synonyms.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Major biomedical databases and manual reference scanning used; no language restrictions beyond English/Chinese.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale; quality threshold was clearly defined and applied (≥6 stars considered high-quality).

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Two reviewers independently extracted data and resolved differences by consensus.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Independent duplicate extraction and prespecified forms minimized data error risk.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Random-effects models, dose–response meta-regression, sensitivity/subgroup/meta-regression analyses applied appropriately.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Egger’s and Begg’s tests conducted with no evidence of bias across smoking-dementia categories.

**Was the impact of bias in individual studies on the results of the review discussed? (2/2):** Limitations of diagnosis validity, exposure misclassification, survival bias, and study heterogeneity discussed in-depth.

**Were the recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Concluded smoking cessation is beneficial for dementia prevention; PAFs calculated to inform public health relevance.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Called for studies on APOE ε4 modification and Mendelian randomization to address residual confounding.
