# Jin et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Aimed to estimate the incidence and relative risk of fractures (all, fragility, and site-specific) in RA patients.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included only cohort studies reporting incident fractures in adult RA populations.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and manual sources with broad keywords and no language restriction.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Final analysis included 25 articles covering 23 cohort studies with over 280,000 RA patients.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Used the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) for quality scoring (see Table 1).

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Appraisal conducted independently by two reviewers.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Dual extraction with resolution by a third reviewer; standardized form used.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis applied; subgroup and cumulative meta-analyses conducted.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s test used across multiple outcomes; no significant bias detected.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Results quantified for overall and site-specific fractures; higher rates for women and Asian cohorts were contextualized.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Called for standardized fracture ascertainment, cost-effectiveness studies, and RA-specific FRAX improvements.
