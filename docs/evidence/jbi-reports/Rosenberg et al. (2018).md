### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Appropriate sample frame (2/2):** Used NHANES data to represent the U.S. noninstitutionalized adult population, with additional adjustments to include incarcerated, homeless, and nursing home residents .

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** NHANES uses a multistage, probability-based sampling strategy. Additional populations were accounted for using stratified modeling and literature-based prevalence inputs.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** 47,387 adults tested across 9 NHANES cycles; model further extended to ~244 million U.S. adults, enabling state-specific prevalence estimates with narrow CIs.

**Subjects and setting described (2/2):** Detailed breakdown by state, demographics, and socioeconomic strata. Tables and maps presented prevalence estimates and affected populations at national and state levels (e.g., Table 2 and Figure 1, page 6).

**Data analysis coverage (2/2):** Full coverage ensured through demographic standardization, mortality-based geographic weighting, and incorporation of hard-to-reach populations.

**Valid condition identification method (2/2):** HCV RNA positivity (current infection) based on NHANES lab testing, supplemented by ICD-10-coded mortality records and validated literature estimates for missing groups.

**Consistent condition measurement (2/2):** Same laboratory and diagnostic criteria applied across NHANES cycles and extrapolated consistently via stratified regression models across states.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations) estimated confidence intervals. State-specific prevalence modeled via logistic regression and mortality ratios (HCV + overdose).

**Response rate and nonresponse management (2/2):** Missing income and NHANES data were imputed, and nonresponse was adjusted via NHANES and ACS weighting procedures. Excluded groups were modeled separately using national literature.
