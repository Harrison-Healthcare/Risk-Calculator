### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim clearly defined to quantify colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in population-based cohorts of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included only studies with geographically defined, population-based UC cohorts using standard diagnostic definitions.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Searches conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and major conference proceedings; no language restrictions applied.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Full search strategy covered four databases and two major GI congress abstracts (2006–2011).

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Studies required clear UC definition, CRC incidence data, and exclusion of referral or pediatric series.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Inclusion decisions made independently by two authors with consensus resolution.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Extraction based on predefined template; calculations standardized using Poisson assumptions where needed.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis used; SIRs calculated and pooled with stratified subgroup analysis and meta-regression.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Sensitivity analyses included to assess impact of individual studies; funnel plot not used due to limited number of studies.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** CRC risk 2.4× higher overall; strongest in men (SIR = 2.6), younger patients (SIR = 8.6), and those with extensive colitis (SIR = 4.8).

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Called for inclusion of inception cohorts, better inflammation control measures, and stratified surveillance guidelines.

| Jess et al. (2012) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Meta-analysis of 8 population-based cohort studies (n ≈ 10,000+ UC patients) found a 2.4-fold increased CRC risk. Fully stratified by sex, age, extent of disease, and cohort size. Publication bias and heterogeneity thoroughly assessed. All criteria met. |
