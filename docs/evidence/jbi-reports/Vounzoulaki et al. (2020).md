# Vounzoulaki et al. (2020)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Focused on estimating and comparing T2DM progression rates in women with gestational diabetes versus healthy controls.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included studies with ≥12 months postpartum follow-up, physician-confirmed T2DM diagnosis, separate GDM/control groups, and clear diagnostic criteria.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched Medline and Embase from 2000–2019 with predefined strategy, supplemented by manual review of systematic review references.

**Sources/resources used adequate (2/2):** Used major medical databases, supplemented with hand searching; search strategy explicitly documented in supplementary material.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Used Newcastle-Ottawa Scale with additional attention to adjustment for confounders; included star rating summary in Supplementary Table S1.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers (EV and SCA), with discrepancies resolved by consensus.

**Methods to minimize data extraction error (2/2):** Used structured Cochrane-based data extraction, consensus checks, and study cross-referencing to avoid duplicates from overlapping cohorts.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian & Laird) and dose-response modeling used; heterogeneity (I² = 96.5%) investigated via subgroup and meta-regression (Figures 2–4, Tables 2–3).

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot symmetry assessed with Begg’s and Egger’s tests (p = 0.58, p = 0.90), showing no significant bias.

**Recommendations for policy/practice supported by data (2/2):** Advocated improved postpartum screening and preventive care based on a nearly 10-fold increased risk of T2DM among women with GDM.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Suggested longitudinal studies using patient-level data to refine incidence estimates and evaluate screening and intervention strategies across diverse populations.

| Vounzoulaki et al. (2020) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 22/22 | 100% | A methodologically rigorous meta-analysis quantifying the long-term risk of type 2 diabetes following gestational diabetes using 20 cohort studies (n > 1.3 million). Comprehensive search, dual reviewer methods, subgroup/meta-regression analyses, and bias checks satisfy all appraisal criteria. |
