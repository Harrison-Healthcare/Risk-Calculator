# Matthews et al. (2020)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** The study explicitly aimed to assess whether recommended levels of physical activity reduce cancer risk and to characterize dose-response relationships.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included prospective cohorts with MET-hours/week data, incident cancer ascertainment, and harmonized covariates.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Derived from previously pooled data and expanded with inclusion of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study; clearly documented inclusion of cohorts and criteria.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Used 9 well-established cohort studies from the U.S., Europe, and Australia with consistent cancer outcome ascertainment.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No mention of formal risk of bias or quality appraisal criteria applied to the included studies.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers independently (1/2):** While harmonization of exposure and covariates occurred, no explicit statement about independent critical appraisal of studies.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Original data pooled and harmonized; analysis conducted using uniform protocols and central coding.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Cox models with restricted cubic splines; stratified by study and adjusted for multiple confounders including BMI.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** IPD reduces publication bias risk; heterogeneity and interaction analyses conducted, including sex-specific effects.

**Impact of bias assessed (2/2):** BMI adjustment tested as a confounder; sensitivity analyses excluded early follow-up years and confirmed stability of associations.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Physical activity (7.5–15 MET-hrs/week) reduced risk of 7 cancers including liver (18–27%), kidney (11–17%), breast (6–10%).

**Appropriate directives for new research (2/2):** Recommends further investigation into biological mechanisms by cancer type and more detailed intensity comparisons.

| Matthews et al. (2020) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | IPD-based meta-analysis of 9 cohorts (n = 755,459). 7.5–15 MET-hours/week of activity was linked to reduced risk for 7 cancers (e.g., breast, colon, endometrial). Dose–response was modeled using splines; BMI-adjusted models and intensity stratification performed. Item 5 – no formal critical appraisal tool applied to included studies; Item 6 – unclear if independent appraisal occurred. |
