# Liu et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Objective to assess the interaction between HIV and HPV in cervical carcinogenesis is clearly presented in title, abstract, and introduction.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Studies included if they reported HPV acquisition, clearance, lesion progression, or cervical cancer incidence by HIV status, CD4, VL, or ART.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** PRISMA-guided search of PubMed, Embase, Global Health, conference abstracts, and reference lists, with inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Multiple databases plus grey literature and references ensured comprehensive coverage.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Quality rated across 5 domains (population, exposure, design bias, analysis, conflict of interest); visualized in Appendix.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Bias assessment followed structured guidelines for observational studies; disagreements resolved by consensus.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized abstraction protocol, pooling by consistent effect measures (RR, HR, OR), and stratified subgroup analyses.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Fixed-effect models with inverse variance weighting used where appropriate; forest plots and IÂ² tests reported.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** While not formally tested (due to limited number of studies per analysis), limitations of small study numbers discussed transparently.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear guidance on ART use and implications for cervical cancer screening policies among HIV-positive women.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Highlights gaps, including impact of viral suppression on CC, better ART adherence measures, and HIV status documentation in cancer registries.
