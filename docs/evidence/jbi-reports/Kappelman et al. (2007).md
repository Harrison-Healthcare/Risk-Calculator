# Kappelman et al. (2007)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** The PharMetrics Database covers 87 health plans in 33 states, representing a diverse national population.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** Uses a comprehensive, census-like approach of insured individuals with continuous 2-year enrollment; not a sampled subset.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** Nearly 9 million enrollees analyzed, allowing precise national estimates and subgroup stratification.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Demographics include age, sex, geographic region, and insurance type; data stratified accordingly.

**Sufficient coverage of sample in analysis (2/2):** Population included both commercial and Medicaid-insured individuals; prevalence adjusted to U.S. census demographics.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (2/2):** Diagnoses based on ICD-9 codes and validated pharmaceutical markers; algorithm adapted from Manitoba registry studies.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** Case definition required â‰¥3 diagnosis codes or 1 diagnosis plus 1 disease-specific medication, ensuring specificity.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Stratified prevalence rates with 95% CIs and adjusted national estimates using logistic regression and census weighting.

**Adequate response rate (2/2):** Not applicable in administrative data, but completeness ensured via continuous enrollment and pharmacy linkage.
