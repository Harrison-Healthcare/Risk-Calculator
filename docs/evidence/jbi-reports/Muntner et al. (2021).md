### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** NHANES sample includes the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population, which is appropriate for estimating national hypertension control trends.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** Multistage probability sampling with oversampling of minorities and proper weighting ensures population representativeness.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** Large sample over 10 survey cycles (n=51,761 overall, 18,262 with hypertension) provides high statistical power and robust subgroup estimates.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Participant demographics, socioeconomic data, and clinical variables were described across survey years with trend tables and stratification.

**Sufficient coverage of sample in analysis (2/2):** Response rates declined from 76% to 49% over time but analytic weighting and imputation were used to address potential bias.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (2/2):** Hypertension defined by measured BP â‰¥140/90 mmHg or antihypertensive medication use; BP measured using a standardized 3-reading protocol.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** Mercury sphygmomanometers used across cycles; consistent measurement protocol, technician training, and calibration ensured data reliability.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Weighted analyses with Joinpoint regression, Poisson models, and multivariable adjustment; sensitivity analyses using ACC/AHA 2017 definitions were included.

**Adequate response rate (2/2):** Although response rate declined, weighting and imputation methods (e.g., Gibbs sampling, multiple imputation) ensured analytical integrity.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Muntner et al. (2021) | JBI Checklist for Prevalence Studies | 18/18 | 100% | Serial cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data (n=51,761; 18,262 with hypertension). BP control improved from 1999 to 2014 but declined thereafter. Full methodological transparency, standard BP measurement protocols, and detailed subgroup stratification. All appraisal criteria met. |
