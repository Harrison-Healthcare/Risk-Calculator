# Larsson et al. (2006)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** The aim was to evaluate the association between diabetes and bladder cancer risk.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included only case–control and cohort studies with RR estimates for bladder cancer and diabetes.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE and manually reviewed references, with no language restrictions.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** MEDLINE plus manual reference checks; comprehensive for the time.

**Criteria for appraising studies (0/2):** No formal quality assessment or critical appraisal tool was described; study appraisal process is absent.

**Critical appraisal by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Implicit in structured extraction process, although not explicitly stated—scored based on author collaboration practices.

**Minimization of data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized data extraction, using the most adjusted risk estimates.

**Appropriate synthesis methods (2/2):** Used random-effects meta-analysis; evaluated heterogeneity and publication bias.

**Publication bias assessment (2/2):** Funnel plot and Egger’s test were used; asymmetry noted but not statistically significant.

**Policy/research recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Conclusions are appropriately cautious, but practice/policy guidance is not addressed.

**Recommendations for future research (2/2):** Clearly stated need for mechanistic and epidemiological research.
