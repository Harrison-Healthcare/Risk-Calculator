### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate to address the target population (2/2):** NHANES is a nationally representative survey of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population.

**Study participants sampled appropriately (2/2):** Multistage probability sampling method was used by NHANES to ensure representativeness.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** The analytic sample included 14,728 participants aged ≥2 years who completed two 24-hour dietary recalls.

**Study subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Demographics, hypertension status, and age categories were clearly described across text and tables (pp. 1–6).

**Data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage (2/2):** Survey weights and stratified variance estimation were applied to account for nonresponse and complex survey design.

**Valid methods used for condition identification (2/2):** Sodium intake assessed via dual 24-hour dietary recalls; hypertension defined by BP or medication use.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** NHANES dietary and blood pressure protocols are standardized and validated across cycles.

**Statistical analysis appropriate (2/2):** Applied complex sample analysis, accounted for day-to-day variability in sodium intake, and adjusted for calorie intake (sodium density).

**Response rate adequate, or managed appropriately (2/2):** Reported response rates (77.3% in 2009–2010; 69.5% in 2011–2012) with appropriate exclusions for pregnancy or unreliable recall.
