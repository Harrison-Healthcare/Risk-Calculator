# Abdullah et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clearly aimed to quantify the magnitude of T2DM risk in overweight and obese individuals compared with normal-weight individuals using prospective cohort studies.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included only prospective cohort studies reporting RR or HR of T2DM by BMI category. Excluded cross-sectional, case-control, and studies with no stratified BMI data.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Used MeSH-based searches across Embase, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science from 1966 to 2008. Over 3500 obesity-diabetes studies were screened, with systematic narrowing to 18 final studies (see Figure 1, p. 310).

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Multiple major databases and hand-screening of references. No restrictions on geography or population type improved comprehensiveness.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Developed quality criteria based on four dimensions: BMI measurement (measured vs. self-report), diabetes ascertainment, number of incident cases, and confounder adjustment. Used these to define high-quality subset (n = 12).

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving discrepancies at each stage.

**Methods to minimize data extraction error (2/2):** Standardized matrix tables for extraction; overlapping cohorts (e.g., Nurses’ Health Study, Framingham) were identified and the most recent analyses retained.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used random-effects meta-analysis (RevMan GIV method) and stratified by population subgroup, study quality, BMI assessment, and diabetes ascertainment (see Table 3, pp. 316–317).

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots showed symmetry, and no evidence of publication bias was detected in RR vs. SE log plots for obesity and diabetes risk.

**Recommendations for policy/practice supported by data (2/2):** Concluded that obesity and overweight significantly increase diabetes risk (RR = 7.19 and 2.99 respectively), supporting need for obesity prevention strategies.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Called for standardized definitions, objective BMI and diabetes measures, and adjustment for consistent confounders to improve comparability in future cohort studies.
