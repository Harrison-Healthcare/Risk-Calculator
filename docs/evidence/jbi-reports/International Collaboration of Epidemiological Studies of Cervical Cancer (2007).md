# International Collaboration of Epidemiological Studies of Cervical Cancer (2007)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim to compare risk factors for cervical squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma clearly stated in abstract and introduction.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Studies included had to report histological subtype and risk factor data (e.g., parity, OC use, sexual behavior) and include â‰¥100 cases.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Studies identified through prior collaborative network and prior publications; included both cohort and case-control designs.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Included 12 international studies spanning developed and developing settings, with robust sample sizes.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Eligible studies needed HPV and histological classification data; data were harmonized centrally and reviewed by experts.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers (2/2):** Individual-level data were cleaned, verified, and consistently recoded by central analysts, with input from study investigators.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Structured data abstraction, standard coding of variables, and floating absolute risks ensured analytical consistency.

**Appropriate methods to combine studies (2/2):** Used stratified conditional logistic regression; floating confidence intervals enabled valid cross-category comparisons.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Included both published and unpublished studies; sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Identified parity and smoking as differential risk factors; screening and HPV effects quantified with clarity.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Recommended greater exploration of adenocarcinoma-specific risk factors and more granular HPV typing.
