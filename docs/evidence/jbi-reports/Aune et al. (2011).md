# Aune et al. (2011)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim to assess both linear and nonlinear dose–response relationships between fruit/vegetable intake and colorectal cancer risk .

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included prospective studies reporting RRs with 95% CIs for colorectal cancer based on fruit/vegetable intake; studies needed at least 3 intake levels for dose-response modeling .

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Searched PubMed up to May 2010 using a prespecified protocol, supplemented by bibliographic hand searches.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** PubMed, previous systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and unpublished WCRF/AICR data were all searched.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Studies assessed for design, dietary assessment method, follow-up duration, number of cases, and confounding control. No numerical score used but subgroup analyses explored quality effects.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Data extracted by 3 authors, checked by 2 more, with procedures verified by the WCRF/AICR team.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Used validated FFQs, recalculated intake levels, and standardized exposure measures (g/day) across studies.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analyses for high vs low, and Greenland & Longnecker and fractional polynomial methods for linear and nonlinear dose-response models.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Egger’s tests and funnel plots showed no significant bias for fruits, vegetables, or combined intake (p = 0.52, 0.79, 0.14 respectively) .

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Identified threshold effect at 100–200 g/day; benefits plateaued beyond that, particularly for vegetables. Colon cancer risk was more consistently reduced than rectal cancer .

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Called for more studies in non-European populations, with repeated dietary measures and biomarker validation .

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aune et al. (2011) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Meta-analysis of 19 prospective cohort studies with 15 included in dose-response modeling. Demonstrated a significant nonlinear inverse association between fruit/vegetable intake and colorectal cancer risk. All appraisal criteria fully met. |
