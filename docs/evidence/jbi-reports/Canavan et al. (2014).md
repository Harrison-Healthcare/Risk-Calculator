# Canavan et al. (2014)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Inclusion criteria clearly defined (2/2):** Describes inclusion based on IBS definitions post-1978 using clinical criteria such as Manning and Rome definitions.

**Study subjects and setting described (2/2):** Paper details population-level prevalence studies and setting across various healthcare systems and countries.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (1/2):** Diagnostic criteria used (Manning, Rome) have variable sensitivity and specificity with acknowledged limitations due to lack of biomarkers.

**Standard criteria used for measurement of condition (1/2):** A range of IBS definitions applied inconsistently (Rome I-III, Manning), with differences in diagnostic stringency noted.

**Confounding factors identified (0/2):** No explicit discussion or listing of potential confounders in the analytical synthesis.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors (2/2):** Adjusts discussion by comparing physician-diagnosed vs community-reported symptoms and stratifying by age, gender, and region.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Uses internationally accepted diagnostic criteria as basis for prevalence estimates and comparative assessments.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Literature review is accompanied by logical analytical structure and use of prevalence/incidence comparisons.

| Canavan et al. (2014) | JBI Analytical Cross-Sectional Checklist | 13/16       | 81.3%                | Moderate to high methodological quality; large-scale literature review with epidemiological analysis. Item 3 – exposure measurement validity unclear; Item 4 – lack of consistent standard diagnostic criteria across studies; Item 5 – no formal identification of confounders. |
