# Li et al. (2021)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Assesses fracture risk in adults on glucocorticoid replacement therapy for CAH, PAI, or SAI.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included all adult studies with fracture outcomes among patients with adrenal insufficiency on replacement therapy.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** PubMed and Web of Science searched without language or publication status restriction; search terms well specified.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** 17 studies included in systematic review, 7 in meta-analysis, with over 3,000 patients and 30,000 controls.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Newcastle–Ottawa Scale used to rate included studies (Table 1, p. 3).

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Quality appraisal tool applied, but independent or blinded assessment not explicitly stated.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Dual screening and structured extraction forms applied; inconsistencies resolved by consensus.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used Mantel-Haenszel method, random/fixed effects based on heterogeneity, with subgroup and sensitivity analysis.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Not performed due to small study number; rationale transparently provided.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Higher odds of fracture consistently reported; patterns by etiology and sex discussed and quantified (e.g., OR = 2.71 for any fracture, OR = 2.76 for osteoporotic fracture).

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Identifies need for future studies on fracture mechanisms, dose response, and generalizability beyond European/US populations.

| Li et al. (2021) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 21/22 | 95.5% | Rigorous meta-analysis of fracture risk in patients on glucocorticoid replacement for adrenal insufficiency; quality assessed using NOS, subgroup analyses robust; Item 6 – unclear if quality appraisal was conducted independently. |
