### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** The aim to assess the association between anxiety and cardiovascular outcomes is explicitly outlined.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Inclusion limited to cohort/nested case-control studies with general population and clearly defined anxiety exposure.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive search across MEDLINE, EMBASE, and bibliographies, using well-defined terms.

**Sources adequate (2/2):** Databases searched from inception with no language restrictions.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers (2/2):** Screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate.

**Methods to minimize extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized forms used; data abstracted in duplicate.

**Methods to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used inverse variance-weighted random-effects meta-analysis; subgroup and sensitivity analyses conducted.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were used.

**Recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Although conclusions were well supported, the impact of potential bias was not explicitly addressed in the recommendation section.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Identified need for causal studies and mechanistic research.
