### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** All participants were middle-aged adults from Finnmark, Norway, recruited using consistent procedures.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Body height and cardiovascular risk factors were uniformly measured at baseline.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Standardized physical measurements (height, BP, lipids) and questionnaires were used.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, diabetes, smoking, BMI, and ethnicity were all recognized and analyzed.

**Strategies to deal with confounders stated (2/2):** Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for key confounders.

**Participants free of the outcome at the start (2/2):** Participants with pre-existing stroke were excluded at baseline.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Stroke events were confirmed via hospital records, death certificates, and physician validation, using WHO criteria.

**Follow-up time reported and long enough (2/2):** Follow-up lasted 14 years, sufficient to observe incident stroke outcomes.

**Loss to follow-up addressed (1/2):** While the authors note a high response rate and track emigration, some data (~3%) may have been missed; no detailed loss rate reported.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (1/2):** Although postal surveys and hospital record checks were conducted, specific strategies to mitigate attrition bias were not detailed.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression with age and multivariate adjustments was correctly applied.

**Outcomes measured similarly for all groups (2/2):** All stroke outcomes were verified using standardized definitions and processes across all participants.

| Njølstad et al. (1996) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 20/22 | 90.9% | Large population-based cohort with long-term follow-up. Strengths include comprehensive adjustment for confounders and reliable outcome ascertainment.
