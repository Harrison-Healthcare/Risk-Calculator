# Bruner et al. (

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly aims to quantify prostate cancer risk by degree of familial relationship using meta-analysis.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included studies reporting RR and 95% CI for prostate cancer risk related to family history, with clear inclusion/exclusion rules in Tables I and II.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** MEDLINE search from 1982–2000 plus reference lists and cyber updates; documented and summarized systematically.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Comprehensive and multifaceted search with 332 initially identified and 23 ultimately included studies.

**Appraisal criteria appropriate (1/2):** Quality was assessed via data abstraction fields and population-source tracking, but no formal tool (e.g., NOS) used.

**Independent critical appraisal (2/2):** Intercoder reliability testing conducted on all included studies with 95% agreement between coders.

**Minimized extraction errors (2/2):** Predefined coding fields were used and discrepancies resolved through team consensus.

**Combination of studies appropriate (2/2):** Pooled RR using inverse variance-weighted estimates in R; cohort studies prioritized for primary analysis to reduce bias.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot constructed (Figure 3, p. 801); minimal evidence of bias except possible influence from McCahy et al..

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Conclusion directly reflects the pooled RRs showing elevated risk by relationship type (father, brother, 1st/2nd-degree).

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Suggests future studies should explore genetic and environmental contributions to familial prostate cancer risk.
