# Fan et al. (2019)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Yes. The review clearly aimed to examine whether short or long sleep duration was associated with risk of all-cause dementia or Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Yes. Only prospective cohort studies reporting HR, RR, or OR for dementia or AD and using at least three sleep duration categories were included.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Comprehensive searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to Dec 1, 2018, with additional manual screening of references; PRISMA flowchart presented on page 3.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Multiple major databases and backward citation checking were used, supporting completeness.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Studies were appraised using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), with individual item-level scores reported in Supplementary Table 1 on page 13.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Yes. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality, with disagreements resolved by consensus.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Dual extraction of study characteristics and effect estimates using a standardized format.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Random-effects models were used. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were reported throughout the results, including Figures 2–3 and Supplementary Figures 1–14.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Publication bias was tested using Egger’s and Begg’s tests; no significant bias was found for any pooled estimate.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Yes. Authors suggested monitoring and management of long sleep duration as a potential modifiable risk factor for dementia.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. The authors called for longitudinal studies using objective sleep measures and assessments of sleep changes over time.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fan et al. (2019) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 22/22 | 100% | Robust meta-analysis assessing sleep duration and dementia risk. Clear eligibility, dual-review process, NOS-based quality scoring, and rigorous sensitivity analyses fully address all criteria. Findings are consistent, biologically plausible, and statistically robust. |
