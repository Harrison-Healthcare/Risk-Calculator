### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Yes. All individuals born in Sweden from 1984–1988, followed in national registers; exclusions were systematic and justified.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Yes. Register-based exposures (e.g., parental death, psychiatric illness, welfare dependency) applied uniformly.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Yes. Derived from official Swedish registers, reducing recall bias and ensuring objective, prospectively collected data.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Yes. Adjusted for parental education, country of birth, birth year, and sex.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Yes. Three Cox regression models were run, with increasing adjustments including all CAs modeled simultaneously.

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Yes. Depression measured between ages 18–28 via new antidepressant prescriptions or psychiatric diagnoses.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Yes. Outcomes included national pharmacy and hospital registry data using ATC and ICD-10 codes.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Yes. 7-year follow-up (2006–2012) beginning in adulthood, long enough to detect incident depression.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Yes. Exclusions (e.g., adoptees, disability pensions) explained; registry-based design ensured minimal attrition.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Yes. Population-based linkage allowed full coverage of events; censoring methods and sensitivity analyses were used.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Yes. Cox models, sensitivity analyses (excluding parental psychiatric morbidity), and population attributable fractions were computed.

| Björkenstam et al. (2017) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 22/22 | 100% | Exceptionally well-conducted national cohort study of over 478,000 Swedish individuals examining childhood adversities and depression. Register-based design, comprehensive exposure/outcome ascertainment, and robust modeling fully satisfy all JBI criteria. |
