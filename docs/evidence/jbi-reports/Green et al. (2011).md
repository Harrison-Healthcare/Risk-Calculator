### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants recruited via the NHS Breast Screening Programme using consistent protocols.

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Height self-reported in a baseline questionnaire and validated in a sub-sample (Pearson r = 0.88).

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Self-reported height strongly correlated with measured values; used mean measured heights in RR models.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Adjusted for socioeconomic status, BMI, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, age at menarche, parity, and age at first birth.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariate Cox regression with stratification and extensive adjustment across 12 factors.

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Women with prior cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) were excluded.

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Cancer diagnoses obtained via NHS cancer registries using ICD-10 coding, with over 99% follow-up completeness.

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was 9.4 years, with over 11.7 million person-years and nearly 100,000 cancer cases.

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Linkage via NHS central registries ensured near-complete ascertainment; <1% loss to follow-up.

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** While follow-up was robust, the paper lacks a discussion on strategies for handling missing data or potential misclassification of exposure.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox models with floating absolute risk methods, subgroup and meta-analytic comparisons performed using standard procedures.
