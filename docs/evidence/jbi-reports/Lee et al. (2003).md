# Lee et al. (2003)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Objective was to assess the association between physical activity/cardiorespiratory fitness and stroke risk.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included 23 epidemiological studies (18 cohort, 5 case-control) assessing stroke incidence/mortality by activity level.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE (1966–2002) and screened references and the Surgeon General’s report.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Sourced from MEDLINE, major government reports, and reference lists.

**Criteria for appraising studies (0/2):** No formal risk-of-bias or quality appraisal of included studies was described.

**Critical appraisal by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Unclear if data were independently verified.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Detailed data abstraction and transformation for meta-analysis (e.g., log-transformed RRs, variance estimation).

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Applied general variance–based fixed-effects model, stratified by design, and tested for heterogeneity.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot and Kendall’s tau used; no evidence of publication bias detected (P = 0.30).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clearly concludes that moderate/high activity reduces total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke risk.

**Specific directives for future research (2/2):** Suggests more studies on hemorrhagic stroke and improved activity quantification, highlighting measurement limitations.

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lee, Folsom, & Blair (2003) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Strong meta-analysis on physical activity and stroke risk with robust methodology and stratified synthesis. Item 5 – quality of studies not appraised beyond inclusion criteria; Item 6 – unclear if data extraction was performed independently by multiple reviewers. |
