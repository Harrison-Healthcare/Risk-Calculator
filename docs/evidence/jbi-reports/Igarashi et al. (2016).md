# Igarashi et al. (2016)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were drawn from a Japanese health screening cohort with consistent inclusion across age and health status.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Family history and metabolic risk factors were collected uniformly through structured questionnaires and lab tests.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Hypertension family history was defined with specific categories (parents, grandparents, siblings); metabolic factors measured with standard devices and validated assays.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Included BMI, age, sex, smoking, physical activity, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and uric acid.

**Strategies to deal with confounders stated (2/2):** Multivariable logistic regression controlled for all major confounders; adjusted and stratified models were used.

**Participants free of the outcome at the start (2/2):** Only normotensive individuals at baseline were included in the prospective analysis (n = 9,766).

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident hypertension defined using standardized thresholds (SBP ≥140 mmHg, DBP ≥90 mmHg, or physician diagnosis).

**Follow-up time reported and long enough (2/2):** 5-year follow-up sufficient for hypertension onset detection.

**Loss to follow-up addressed (2/2):** Minimal exclusions noted; large sample retained over 5 years with documented baseline and follow-up BP.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** While not described in detail, the minimal missing data and full re-measurement at follow-up suggest low attrition bias.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Multivariate logistic regression and interaction modeling were applied; odds ratios reported with 95% CI.
