# Peters et al. (2016)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Clearly investigates sex-specific differences in the relationship between total cholesterol and cardiovascular outcomes.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Inclusion criteria required cohort studies reporting sex-specific RRs for CHD or stroke, adjusted for at least age.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Detailed PubMed search strategy using relevant MeSH and free-text terms; supplemented with reference checks.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Used major biomedical databases (PubMed) and IPD from large studies such as APCSC, ARIC, NHANES, SHHEC.

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** A modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale is mentioned.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Two reviewers screened and extracted data independently; disagreements resolved by a third reviewer.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Used a pre-designed data extraction form and multiple reviewers to reduce extraction bias.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Used inverse-variance weighted random-effects meta-analysis and tested for heterogeneity and publication bias.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Funnel plots and Begg’s test used, but the authorship roles and decision-making responsibilities are not clearly articulated.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (1/2):** Data support general recommendations, but the potential impact of study bias on findings is not explored.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Authors recommend further research on sex differences in lipid metabolism and responses to lipid-lowering therapy.
