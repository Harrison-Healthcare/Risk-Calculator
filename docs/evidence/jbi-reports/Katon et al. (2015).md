### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were Danish citizens aged ≥50 without dementia at baseline, drawn from a unified national population registry.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to both exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Depression and DM were identified through validated national registries using consistent, predefined diagnostic or medication criteria across all participants.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Depression and DM data came from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, Prescription Registry, and Diabetes Register, each with high predictive validity (e.g., DM PPV = 89%).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Adjusted for demographics, calendar period, and a wide range of comorbidities including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic conditions.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Used multivariable Cox models adjusting for multiple potential confounders and intermediates (e.g., ischemic heart disease, retinopathy).

**Groups/participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Only individuals without dementia as of January 1, 2007 were included; all dementia cases were incident.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Incident dementia was identified through validated algorithms using hospital, psychiatric, and prescription data with high diagnostic validity.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Participants were followed for up to 7 years, contributing over 13.8 million person-years—ample to detect dementia outcomes.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Minimal loss to follow-up; outcomes tracked via linked national data sources; censoring accounted for deaths, migration, or diagnosis of exclusionary conditions.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Delayed entry and censoring rules were applied; sensitivity analyses tested alternate definitions of exposure onset.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression models with age as the underlying timescale, interaction models, and attributable proportion analyses were used rigorously.
