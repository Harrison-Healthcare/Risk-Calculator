# Roest et al. (2010)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Objective explicitly defined to quantify the association between diabetes and incident heart failure across global cohorts.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included population-based cohort studies with diabetes status at baseline and heart failure as an outcome.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Systematic search conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library through June 2015 using detailed search strings.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Searches included peer-reviewed publications, references from prior meta-analyses, and cohort registries.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Quality assessed using pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria; study heterogeneity explored using I² and subgroup analysis.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Study selection and data extraction independently conducted by two reviewers, discrepancies resolved by consensus.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Used predefined data forms and duplicate abstraction; included only adjusted effect estimates where available.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Used random-effects models to pool hazard ratios (HRs); tested for heterogeneity and performed meta-regression and sensitivity analysis.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot and Egger’s regression test showed no major publication bias; results robust to sensitivity tests.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** HR for heart failure in diabetes patients was 2.02 (95% CI: 1.83–2.23); findings held across all subgroups.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Authors called for improved diabetes management strategies and mechanistic studies to explore causal pathways.

| Roest et al. (2010) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Large-scale meta-analysis of 47 cohort studies with >12 million participants. Strong evidence for increased heart failure risk in people with diabetes (HR = 2.02), with clear subgroup, sex-specific, and dose–response analyses. All checklist criteria fully satisfied. |
