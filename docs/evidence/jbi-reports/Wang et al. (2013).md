### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Investigated whether elevated levels of IL-6 and CRP are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included prospective cohort, nested case-control, and case-cohort studies in non-diabetic adults with ≥1 year follow-up and outcome ascertainment of incident diabetes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searched PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library through February 2012 using comprehensive and clearly documented search terms.

**Sources and resources used adequate (2/2):** Multiple databases and manual reference checks were used; no language restrictions applied.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Study quality was assessed using a Newcastle-Ottawa Scale–derived scoring system; studies were labeled as low, moderate, or high quality.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently (2/2):** Dual-reviewer screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed with discrepancies resolved by consensus with a third reviewer.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Standardized data forms and independent duplicate extraction minimized error and ensured consistency.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used generalized least squares for trend estimation (GLST) and random-effects models; stratified analyses and dose-response modeling applied (Figures 1–3, pages 171–173).

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Begg’s and Egger’s tests were used; no evidence of publication bias was detected for IL-6 or CRP analyses.

**Recommendations for policy/practice supported by reported data (2/2):** Suggested IL-6 and CRP as potential markers for identifying high-risk individuals for type 2 diabetes and emphasized targeting inflammation in prevention strategies.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Recommended further studies to assess causal mechanisms, explore heterogeneity by sex and ethnicity, and validate predictive models using IL-6 and CRP.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wang et al. (2013) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 22/22 | 100% | Rigorous meta-analysis of 19 prospective studies assessing IL-6 and CRP in relation to type 2 diabetes risk. Detailed protocol, independent dual-review process, robust dose-response modeling, and extensive subgroup/sensitivity analyses meet all JBI criteria. |
