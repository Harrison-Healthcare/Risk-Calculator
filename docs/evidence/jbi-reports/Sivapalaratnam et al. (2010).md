### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants aged 40–79 recruited from general practices in Norfolk, UK; all free of CHD or stroke at baseline .

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Self-reported family history of CHD in first-degree relatives collected via standardized health questionnaire .

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Family history categorized as premature (men <55, women <65); although self-reported, prior studies confirm reasonable accuracy (sensitivity >80%, specificity ~90%).

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Models adjusted for Framingham Risk Score (FRS) factors: age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, smoking .

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Adjusted Cox regression models, stratified by type and timing of family history; subgroup and interaction terms used .

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** 2,798 individuals with prior CHD/stroke excluded, ensuring incident outcome assessment .

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** CHD events ascertained via hospital and death registry linkage, previously validated for high specificity .

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up was 10.9 years; 2,752 incident CHD cases recorded among 22,841 participants .

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** National Health Service linkage ensured comprehensive mortality and hospital record coverage; only one subject lost to follow-up .

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No specific strategies or discussion for missing data or time-varying covariates, though loss appears minimal .

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox models, reclassification metrics, and sensitivity/specificity analyses employed to assess incremental value of family history .

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sivapalaratnam et al. (2010) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | EPIC-Norfolk cohort (n=22,841) with 11 years of follow-up. Family history of CHD was an independent predictor (HR = 1.74), but did not significantly improve risk classification. Item 10 – no explicit methods for managing loss to follow-up or missing data despite near-complete outcome capture. |
