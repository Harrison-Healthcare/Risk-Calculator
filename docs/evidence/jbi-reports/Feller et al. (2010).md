### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similarity of groups and recruitment (2/2):** Participants were from the same population (EPIC-Potsdam), covering similar demographic and geographic characteristics.

**Exposure measurement for both groups (2/2):** BMI and waist circumference were measured using standardized WHO procedures across all participants.

**Validity and reliability of exposure (2/2):** Trained personnel followed standardized protocols; anthropometrics were measured rather than self-reported.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Authors adjusted for key confounders including age, height, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, education, and workplace stress.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Confounding addressed through multivariable Cox regression analysis with stratification and adjustment.

**Outcome-free at baseline (2/2):** Individuals with prior diabetes or missing confirmation data were excluded, ensuring a disease-free cohort at baseline.

**Validity and reliability of outcome measurement (2/2):** Diabetes diagnosis was confirmed by physician reports and ICD-10 coding (E11).

**Follow-up duration sufficient (2/2):** Mean follow-up of 8 years is adequate for type 2 diabetes development.

**Follow-up completeness (1/2):** Exclusions for incomplete follow-up were noted, but detailed statistics on attrition and handling are not fully presented.

**Addressing incomplete follow-up (1/2):** While exclusions were mentioned, no specific strategies (e.g., imputation, sensitivity analysis) to address follow-up loss were described.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Use of Cox regression with stratification and multivariable adjustment was appropriate and thorough.
