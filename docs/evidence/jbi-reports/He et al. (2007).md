# He et al. (2007)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Objective to assess the dose–response association between fruit/vegetable intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) is clearly presented.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included only prospective cohort studies with relative risk (RR) or hazard ratios for CHD and quantifiable fruit/vegetable intake.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library through November 2005 using defined MeSH/text terms and Boolean logic.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Included peer-reviewed full articles; reference lists were also scanned for eligible studies.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Defined a 3-tier classification of intake (low, medium, high) and excluded studies reporting only surrogate nutrients or binary exposures.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Data extracted by three authors independently with a fourth resolving differences.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Used standardized protocols and recalculated intake levels using USDA nutrient databases and harmonized exposure measures.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting; heterogeneity assessed via I² and Q-statistics.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s test conducted; slight asymmetry noted, but Egger's p-values > 0.2 suggest minimal bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** ≥5 servings/day associated with a 17% CHD risk reduction (RR = 0.83), while 3–5 servings/day had borderline benefit (RR = 0.93).

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Encourages more precise intake reporting, repeated measures, and trials isolating fruit/vegetable effects beyond lifestyle confounders.

| He et al. (2007) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Meta-analysis of 13 prospective cohorts (n = 278,459; 9,143 CHD events). High fruit/vegetable intake (≥5 servings/day) linked to 17% reduced CHD risk. Extensive stratified analysis, heterogeneity evaluation, and bias assessment. All criteria clearly satisfied. |
