# Lambe et al. (1996)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups comparable other than disease status (2/2):** Controls were individually matched to cases by birth month and year, ensuring high comparability.

**Cases and controls matched appropriately (2/2):** Five controls per case matched by age; only living, cancer-free residents included as controls.

**Same criteria used for identification (2/2):** Cases identified via the Swedish Cancer Registry; controls drawn from the Fertility Registry with no breast cancer at index date.

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Fertility data obtained from a national database based on census and vital statistics records, with known accuracy.

**Exposure measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** Birth histories were extracted identically from registry data for both cases and controls.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Key confounders including age, parity, and age at first and last birth were identified and considered in stratified and adjusted models.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used, adjusting for parity and birth ages in multiple models.

**Outcomes assessed validly and reliably (2/2):** Breast cancer diagnoses based on near-complete coverage from the national cancer registry.

**Exposure period of interest long enough (2/2):** Reproductive data included timing of all births, some up to decades before diagnosis, sufficient for assessing latency in breast cancer risk.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Conditional logistic regression applied with multiple stratified and continuous exposure models, supported by large sample size.

| Lambe et al. (1996) | JBI Checklist for Case Control Studies | 20/20 | 100% | Large, population-based nested case-control study using national Swedish registries. Exposure and outcome data robust and uniformly applied. Adjusted analyses account for age, parity, and birth timing. No concerns. |
