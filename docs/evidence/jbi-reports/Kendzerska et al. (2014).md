### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Similarity of groups (2/2):** All participants underwent sleep studies at a single center and were drawn from a referred population for suspected OSA; baseline characteristics reported and stratified by AHI categories.

**Exposure measured similarly (2/2):** In-lab full polysomnography conducted using standardized protocols and consistent scoring definitions over the study period.

**Validity/reliability of exposure (2/2):** AHI and other sleep parameters were defined per AASM standards and assessed via trained staff; same protocol applied throughout.

**Confounders identified (2/2):** Age, sex, BMI, smoking, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and more were included based on literature and expert input.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox regression with variable selection, time-dependent models, competing risk models, and sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding.

**Outcome-free at baseline (2/2):** Individuals with prior diabetes were excluded using validated algorithms from the Ontario Diabetes Database.

**Outcome measurement (2/2):** Incident diabetes identified using validated administrative algorithms with 86% sensitivity and 97% specificity.

**Sufficient follow-up (2/2):** Median follow-up was 67 months; sufficient to detect incident diabetes.

**Complete follow-up (2/2):** Linked health records for mortality and diabetes outcomes using provincial databases with universal health coverage ensured near-complete follow-up.

**Addressing incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Competing risk models accounted for death; imputation used for missing covariates.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Cox regression, spline models, Fine & Gray competing risk, binomial log models, and sensitivity checks for unmeasured confounding were all used appropriately.
