# Li et al. (2015)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clearly framed question examining the relationship between fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption and risk of hypertension.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Inclusion criteria defined by study design, population, exposure (FV), and outcome (hypertension diagnosis), with exclusion of trials and overlapping data.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science up to April 2015, using a structured Boolean strategy described in Data S1.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Two databases searched with language restriction (English and Chinese), plus reference screening, capturing 25 studies from 23 articles.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal quality or risk-of-bias tool used for appraising individual study quality; study characteristics were extracted but not appraised.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers (1/2):** Data extraction was conducted by two authors independently, but it is unclear if critical appraisal (had it existed) was also performed independently.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Dual independent extraction was used; discrepancies resolved by a third author.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis using random/fixed effects models depending on heterogeneity; heterogeneity assessed with I², REML, and meta-regression.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s test were used; small-study effect was explored and sensitivity analyses were conducted to address one influential study.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Recommendations aligned with findings—FV and fruit consumption were inversely associated with hypertension risk, especially in Asia and with investigator-measured BP.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Authors called for more prospective cohort studies, particularly with standardized BP and diet measurement methods.

| Li et al. (2015) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 20/22 | 90.9% | Robust dose-response meta-analysis of FV intake and hypertension. Item 5 – no formal quality appraisal described; Item 6 – dual data extraction but unclear if appraisal was duplicate. |
