# Pai et al. (2004)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Groups similar and from same population (2/2):** Participants were from NHS and HPFS cohorts, all free from CVD at baseline, and matched on key variables like age and smoking .

**Exposure measured similarly for all (2/2):** Plasma biomarkers (CRP, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, IL-6) measured using standardized immunoassays with low CVs .

**Exposure measured validly and reliably (2/2):** All assays validated, stored under strict protocols, with quality control; biomarker levels shown stable over time .

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Adjusted for age, BMI, cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, alcohol, diabetes, hypertension, and hormone therapy .

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Used multivariable logistic regression and stratified models with interaction terms for key covariates .

**Free of outcome at start (2/2):** Cases were incident coronary events occurring after baseline blood draw in participants initially free of CVD .

**Outcome measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Nonfatal MI and fatal CHD confirmed using WHO criteria or death certificate plus medical record review .

**Follow-up time sufficient (2/2):** Women followed for 8 years, men for 6 years, with consistent event documentation .

**Loss to follow-up described (2/2):** Near-complete follow-up due to registry linkage and biennial questionnaires; minimal exclusion for missing data .

**Strategies for incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No explicit handling strategy for missing data or loss to follow-up described, despite low exclusion rates .

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Used conditional and unconditional logistic regression with risk-set sampling; sensitivity and trend tests applied .

| Pai et al. (2004) | JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies | 21/22 | 95.5% | Nested case-control within two large prospective cohorts (NHS and HPFS). Biomarkers assessed from stored plasma; matched controls with rigorous adjustment. Item 10 â€“ lacks explicit strategy for handling loss to follow-up or missing outcome data. |
