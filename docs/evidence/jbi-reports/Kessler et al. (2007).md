### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** Nationally and regionally representative household samples across 17 countries using census and registry data.

**Appropriate sampling method (2/2):** Stratified multistage clustered area probability sampling with household selection and random respondent identification.

**Adequate sample size (2/2):** 85,052 respondents with high response rates (mean = 71.1%, range: 45.9â€“87.7%) ensure precise estimates across countries.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Demographics, sample sizes, and response rates reported per country; methodology stratified by age, education, and geographic region.

**Sufficient coverage of sample in analysis (2/2):** National and urban representative samples weighted to match population distributions; data collection included standardized training and QC.

**Valid methods used to identify the condition (2/2):** WHO-CIDI Version 3.0 used to diagnose DSM-IV disorders with clinical calibration and validated against SCID interviews.

**Condition measured reliably (2/2):** Disorders assessed through structured interviews, translated and back-translated using WHO protocols, with clinical reappraisal studies showing good validity.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Lifetime prevalence and projected lifetime risk estimated using survival analysis; standard errors computed via Taylor series and jackknife methods.

**Adequate response rate (2/2):** Nonresponse biases discussed and weighted; response rates and demographic representativeness described in detail for each country.
