### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was the sample frame appropriate? (2/2):** NHANES provides a nationally representative frame of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population.

**Were study participants sampled appropriately? (2/2):** Employed complex, stratified, multistage probability sampling design across five survey cycles.

**Was the sample size adequate? (2/2):** 26,248 participants aged ≥20 were interviewed, with 356 glucocorticoid users identified—sufficient to estimate prevalence and stratify by sex/age.

**Were the study subjects and setting described in detail? (2/2):** Detailed by age, sex, medication class, duration of use, and concurrent osteoporosis treatment (see Table 1 on page 2).

**Was the data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage of the identified sample? (2/2):** NHANES sample weights and variance estimation methods were appropriately applied.

**Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition? (2/2):** Oral glucocorticoid use was captured via NHANES’ validated self-reported 30-day medication use protocols, using Lexicon categories.

**Was the condition measured in a standard, reliable way for all participants? (2/2):** Medication classes standardized using the Multum Lexicon Drug Database; duration and type clearly recorded across all subjects.

**Was there appropriate statistical analysis? (2/2):** Used SAS survey procedures, linearized variance estimates, and NHANES analytic weights across cycles.

**Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low response rate managed appropriately? (2/2):** NHANES response rate of 74.5% is robust; weights were adjusted for nonresponse across survey cycles.
