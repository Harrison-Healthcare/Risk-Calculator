# Abusal et al. (2022)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim to evaluate the association between oral contraceptive (OC) use and colorectal cancer risk is explicitly stated in the abstract and introduction.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included cohort and case-control studies with clear differentiation between OC and HRT, and self-reported exposure data.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** PRISMA-based search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane up to May 2022 using Boolean operators and field tags.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Three databases plus reference lists of past systematic reviews searched thoroughly.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Studies not excluded based on quality scores, but sensitivity analyses were used to assess robustness.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Data were independently extracted and validated using Cochrane guidelines.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Standardized data extraction sheet used; estimates adjusted for confounders were preferred.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Fixed-effect model with inverse variance weighting; subgroup and sensitivity analyses conducted; I² = 99% indicates substantial heterogeneity.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plot assessed (Fig. 4, page 6), no significant asymmetry reported.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Use of OCs associated with reduced CRC risk (RR = 0.53 [95% CI: 0.51–0.56]); findings consistent with prior meta-analyses.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Advocated investigation into biological mechanisms, OC formulation types, and duration/recency patterns.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Abusal et al. (2022) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Meta-analysis of 8 studies (3 case-control, 5 cohort) on OC use and colorectal cancer. Strong effect observed (RR = 0.53). Search, selection, data extraction, and bias assessment followed PRISMA/Cochrane standards. No checklist concerns. |
