# Yu et al. (2019)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Explicitly aimed to assess stroke risk associated with specific types of family history.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Included observational studies that reported maternal, paternal, or sibling stroke history.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive PubMed and Embase search (1990–2017), with defined search terms.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Two major databases searched plus reference list screening.

**Criteria for appraising studies (2/2):** Used Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) for formal quality assessment.

**Independent appraisal by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Two authors independently performed screening and data extraction.

**Methods to minimize errors in extraction (2/2):** Data were double-checked and discrepancies resolved by discussion.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis with stratification by history type, study design, and demographics.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Assessed using funnel plots and statistical tests (Begg’s, Egger’s).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Recommendations align with pooled risk estimates and subgroup findings.

**Specific directives for future research (2/2):** Suggested incorporating more detailed familial and genetic information.
