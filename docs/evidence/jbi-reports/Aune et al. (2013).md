# Aune et al. (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clear objective to quantify dose–response relationship between whole/refined grain intake and type 2 diabetes.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Restricted to prospective cohorts with specified outcome and exposure data.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Comprehensive PubMed search and backward reference checking.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** PubMed and existing meta-analyses used; dates and search terms reported.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal critical appraisal tool or criteria described for assessing study quality.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers independently (1/2):** Data extraction by multiple reviewers mentioned, but independent appraisal process not confirmed.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Independent extraction with consensus resolution.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used random-effects models, generalized least squares, and fractional polynomial models.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Both Egger’s and Begg’s tests conducted.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clearly grounded in findings and explicitly discussed.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Identifies key evidence gaps in grain subtype studies and biological mechanisms.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aune et al. (2013) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Strong synthesis and analysis with advanced dose–response modeling and robust statistical techniques. Item 5 – no formal critical appraisal reported; Item 6 – unclear if independent appraisal of included studies occurred. All other criteria met. |
