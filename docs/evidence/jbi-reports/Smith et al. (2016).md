# Smith et al. (2016)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** The objective was to assess the dose–response relationship between physical activity and type 2 diabetes incidence.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Inclusion criteria covered prospective cohort design, diabetes-free baseline status, and PA reporting in MET units.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Searches conducted in PubMed and EMBASE, supplemented by manual reference checking (p. 2).

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Comprehensive and unrestricted literature search across multiple databases and prior reviews.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** Although quality scores using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale were reported (p. 3), there is no indication that these were used to include/exclude studies or weight results.

**Critical appraisal by two or more reviewers independently (1/2):** Title/abstract screening was conducted in duplicate, but it’s unclear if full-text quality assessments or data extraction were independently done.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Detailed harmonization steps, with multiple authors validating PA exposure assumptions and recalculating exposure levels (p. 3–4).

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Used generalized least squares and restricted cubic splines; pooled estimates using random-effects models.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Egger’s test and funnel plot conducted; no bias found (p. 4).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Findings and policy relevance clearly supported.

**Directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Highlights need for improved PA measurement, inclusion of more diverse cohorts, and objective data integration (p. 16–17).

| Study ID | Checklist Used | Total Score | Normalized Score (%) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Smith et al. (2016) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Extensive dose–response meta-analysis using harmonized physical activity metrics. Item 5 – no formal risk of bias appraisal reported; Item 6 – unclear if independent review conducted; Item 10 – little discussion on how bias may affect pooled estimates. |
