# Littman et al. (2004)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from same population (2/2):** All participants came from CARET, with detailed eligibility criteria for heavy smokers and asbestos-exposed workers.

**Exposures measured similarly for both groups (2/2):** History of lung disease assessed uniformly by physician diagnosis at baseline.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Conditions assessed using structured questionnaire and partially validated by spirometry.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Smoking intensity, duration, and cessation were comprehensively measured and adjusted.

**Strategies to deal with confounding factors (2/2):** Models adjusted for multiple smoking variables and stratified by smoking status.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Lung cancer incidence tracked from baseline in disease-free participants.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Confirmed through pathology reports and national cancer registries.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was 9.1 years, with up to 16 years of data.

**Follow-up complete and reasons for loss described (2/2):** While follow-up was long, specific attrition data were not detailed; outcome data appear robust.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (1/2):** No explicit discussion of loss-to-follow-up mitigation; bias potential mentioned as a limitation.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox regression models with testing of proportional hazards assumptions.
