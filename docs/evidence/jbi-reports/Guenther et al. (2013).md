### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Inclusion criteria clearly defined (2/2):** Included all NHANES participants aged 21+ with valid 24-hour dietary recalls from 2009–2010 data.

**Study subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Participants stratified by age and sex; national representativeness achieved through complex sampling weights.

**Exposure measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Alcohol intake captured via standardized 24-hour dietary recalls using USDA’s validated multiple-pass method.

**Objective, standard criteria used for measurement (2/2):** Alcohol consumption categorized per 2010 Dietary Guidelines, using established thresholds for moderate and heavy drinking.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Analyses stratified by age and sex, with national sampling adjustments; discussion of potential underreporting bias included.

**Strategies to deal with confounding stated (2/2):** Used NHANES-provided survey weights, jackknife variance estimates, and age-group stratification to reduce confounding.

**Outcomes measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Alcoholic beverage intake measured as number of standard drinks (14 g ethanol), with national standards and databases applied.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Applied Stata survey procedures, logistic regression, F-tests, and jackknife method for national estimates and confidence intervals.
