# Tsoi et al. (2009)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aim to assess the association between smoking and CRC risk using only prospective cohort data was clearly stated in the abstract and introduction.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included prospective cohort studies with ≥1000 participants and reported relative risks for CRC stratified by smoking category.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Comprehensive literature search in MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1950–2008, plus manual reference review.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Both databases and bibliographies included, ensuring wide coverage of relevant studies.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Quality scored using 6-point appraisal covering follow-up, bias control, exposure/outcome definition, and loss-to-follow-up.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Dual reviewer selection and extraction, with arbitration by a third reviewer in case of discrepancies.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Double entry of data, predefined data forms, and detailed adjustment variable tracking.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Pooled RRs calculated using random-effects model with heterogeneity testing and subgroup analysis.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Begg and Egger tests used; trim-and-fill adjustment slightly reduced RR from 1.20 to 1.15.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear dose-response effect reported, with RRs increasing with cigarettes/day, smoking years, and pack-years.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Suggests further research on gender differences, screening behaviors, and rectal vs colonic cancer mechanisms.

| Tsoi et al. (2009) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Meta-analysis of 28 cohorts (n=1.46 million) showing dose-dependent CRC risk increases in smokers. Fully stratified by gender, cancer site, and exposure intensity. High-quality and robust analysis with all JBI criteria met. |
