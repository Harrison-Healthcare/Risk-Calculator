# Li et al. (2022)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were from the HPFS, and exclusions ensured homogeneity in baseline characteristics.

**Exposures measured similarly (2/2):** Eye color was assessed through standardized questionnaires at baseline.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Eye color is a stable phenotypic trait and unlikely to be misclassified; data collection was validated.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Covariates like BMI, UVB exposure, smoking, sunburn history, and hair color were considered.

**Strategies to deal with confounding (2/2):** Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for numerous known risk factors.

**Participants free of outcome at start (2/2):** Individuals with prior history of skin cancers were excluded from analysis.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Melanoma and SCC cases were physician-confirmed; BCC validated by prior studies in HPFS.

**Follow-up time reported and sufficient (2/2):** Median follow-up was 19 years, sufficient for skin cancer outcome detection.

**Follow-up complete or reasons for loss described (2/2):** Follow-up was effectively complete through systematic linkage and family/death registry reports.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** While not separately described, minimal loss implied due to robust follow-up systems in HPFS.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Cox models stratified by age and questionnaire cycle, with sensitivity and interaction analyses.
