# Ohayon & Schatzberg (2003)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Were the criteria for inclusion in the sample clearly defined? (2/2):** Yes. Included non-institutionalized adults aged ≥15 years from 5 European countries, selected using a 2-stage design with geographic and random household selection.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Yes. Sample size (n = 18,980), demographics, countries, and participation rates per country were reported; sample stratified by age and sex.

**Was the exposure measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** Yes. Pain was identified based on duration ≥6 months and confirmation via consultation, medication, or functional interference; categorized into 5 pain types.

**Were objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition? (2/2):** Yes. Depression was assessed using a DSM-IV-based diagnostic algorithm in the Sleep-EVAL system, which has demonstrated validity across studies.

**Were confounding factors identified? (2/2):** Yes. Variables such as age, sex, occupational status, BMI, stress level, smoking, and comorbid non-painful conditions were considered in the analysis.

**Were strategies to deal with confounding factors stated? (2/2):** Yes. Logistic regression controlled for sociodemographic and health variables; adjusted odds ratios were reported for all relevant comparisons.

**Were the outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way? (2/2):** Yes. Major depressive disorder was determined using validated structured diagnostic criteria and symptom algorithms within the Sleep-EVAL platform.

**Was appropriate statistical analysis used? (2/2):** Yes. Weighted estimates with 95% CIs, chi-square tests, and logistic regression (SUDAAN software) were applied, accounting for complex survey design.
