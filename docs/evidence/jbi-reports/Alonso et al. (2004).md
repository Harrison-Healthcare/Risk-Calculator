### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Sample frame appropriate (2/2):** The study targeted the non-institutionalized adult population of six European countries, representing 212 million people.

**Sampling method appropriate (2/2):** Stratified, multistage clustered area probability sampling was used, ensuring representativeness.

**Sample size adequate (2/2):** The final sample included 21,425 participants, with calculations considering design effects and national representativeness.

**Subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Detailed demographic and geographic distributions were provided, including by country, age, education, and employment.

**Data analysis coverage adequate (1/2):** While weighting and adjustment were used, the paper lacks specific breakdowns on missing data and the representativeness of subsample responses.

**Valid methods for condition identification (2/2):** DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed using the WMH-CIDI, a structured and validated diagnostic instrument.

**Standard, reliable condition measurement (2/2):** Standardized interviews were conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), with clinical calibration via SCID.

**Appropriate statistical analysis (2/2):** Weighted prevalence estimates and logistic regression were used, accounting for the complex survey design.

**Response rate adequate and managed (1/2):** The overall response rate was 61.2%, but lower in France and Belgium; authors acknowledged but did not fully assess potential non-response bias.

| Alonso et al. (2004) | JBI Checklist for Prevalence Studies | 16/18 | 90.0% | High-quality multinational prevalence survey. Strengths include rigorous sampling, standardized diagnostic tools, and analytic weighting. Item 5 – unclear analysis coverage; Item 9 – limited handling of low response bias. |
