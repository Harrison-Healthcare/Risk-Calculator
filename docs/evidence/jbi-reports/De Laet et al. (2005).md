### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clearly aimed to quantify fracture risk associated with BMI and assess effect modification by age, sex, and BMD .

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Included prospective population-based cohorts with baseline BMI and validated fracture outcomes.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Selected known international cohorts; while not a database-driven search, inclusion strategy was systematic and transparent.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** Over 59,000 participants from 12 cohorts across Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia, with >250,000 person-years of follow-up.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** No formal quality assessment tool or predefined appraisal criteria for included cohorts was reported.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** Data were harmonized and verified across studies, but no mention of independent or dual critical appraisal.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Used original individual-level data; BMD standardized to Z-scores; statistical models run per cohort then meta-analyzed.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Poisson regression within cohorts; fixed-effects model justified due to low heterogeneity (e.g., I² = 8% for hip fractures).

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Mitigated by using unpublished IPD rather than relying on published aggregate data; funnel plots or formal tests not needed due to design.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Detailed results stratified by BMI, fracture type, and BMD adjustment; consistent interpretation (e.g., RR for hip fracture ~0.93 per unit BMI).

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Advocated using BMI in fracture risk prediction tools, even without BMD, and called for further research into BMI thresholds and mechanisms.
