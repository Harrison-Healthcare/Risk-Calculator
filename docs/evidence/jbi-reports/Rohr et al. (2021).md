### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Was the sample frame appropriate to address the target population? (2/2):** Yes. Participants were sampled from the Leipzig city registry, representing the urban adult population aged 18–79 years.

**Were study participants sampled in an appropriate way? (2/2):** Yes. Stratified random sampling by age and sex was used to recruit a representative adult cohort of 10,000 individuals.

**Was the sample size adequate? (2/2):** Yes. Final analysis included 9,392 participants with complete LSNS-6 data, providing narrow confidence intervals and subgroup estimates.

**Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail? (2/2):** Yes. Detailed breakdown of gender, age, SES, education, household composition, and employment status was provided (Table 1).

**Was the data analysis conducted with sufficient coverage of the identified sample? (2/2):** Yes. Sampling weights were applied to match the 2012 Leipzig census demographics, enhancing generalizability.

**Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition? (2/2):** Yes. Social isolation was measured using the LSNS-6, with a validated cutoff score <12 as the standard indicator.

**Was the condition measured in a standard, reliable way for all participants? (2/2):** Yes. All participants received the same LSNS-6 instrument via standardized interviews.

**Was there appropriate statistical analysis? (2/2):** Yes. Weighted prevalence with 95% CIs, stratified analyses by SES/gender/age, chi-square tests, and multivariable logistic regression were conducted.

**Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low response rate managed appropriately? (2/2):** Yes. Although the response rate was 33%, weighting adjusted for differential sampling fractions, and dropout bias was discussed transparently.
