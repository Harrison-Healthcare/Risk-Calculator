# Mijtabai & Crum (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Two groups similar and recruited from the same population (2/2):** Participants were drawn from the nationally representative NESARC sample, stratified and weighted to match the U.S. population.

**Exposures measured similarly to assign people to exposed/unexposed groups (2/2):** Smoking was consistently assessed using structured self-report measures at baseline and follow-up, with clear categorization of smoking status.

**Exposure measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** The number of cigarettes per day over 3 years was calculated using a well-defined formula based on frequency and quantity reports.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Adjusted for a comprehensive list including sociodemographics, physical health, and other mental and substance use disorders.

**Strategies to deal with confounders stated (2/2):** Both logistic regression and instrumental variable methods were used to account for confounding and endogeneity.

**Participants free of the outcome at the start (2/2):** Analyses excluded individuals with lifetime diagnoses of the target disorders at baseline, ensuring incident case evaluation.

**Outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way (2/2):** Diagnoses were based on the AUDADIS-IV, a structured interview aligned with DSM-IV criteria.

**Follow-up time reported and long enough (2/2):** Three-year follow-up allowed for sufficient observation of incident mood and anxiety disorders.

**Loss to follow-up addressed (2/2):** Of 39,959 eligible baseline respondents, 34,653 completed follow-up (87% response), and those lost were documented with clear criteria.

**Strategies to address incomplete follow-up (2/2):** Survey weights and design adjustments were used to maintain national representativeness and minimize attrition bias.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (2/2):** Employed multivariate logistic regressions and instrumental variable probit models to correct for endogeneity.
