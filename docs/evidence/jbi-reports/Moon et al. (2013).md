# Moon et al. (2013)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Aimed to quantify regional RR variation and implications for PAF from asbestos exposure.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question (2/2):** Inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to identify original studies reporting RR estimates.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Systematic MEDLINE search with no restrictions; supplemented by reference screening.

**Sources and resources adequate (2/2):** 160 studies included after thorough screening of over 7000 citations.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (0/2):** Authors did not assess or report on methodological quality of included studies.

**Critical appraisal conducted independently by ≥2 reviewers (1/2):** No explicit mention of independent appraisal procedures.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Flow diagram and detailed methods indicate a structured selection and abstraction process.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Employed random-effects models and stratified meta-analyses to address heterogeneity.

**Publication bias assessed (0/2):** No funnel plot, Egger’s test, or any other publication bias assessment discussed.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Emphasized regional variability in RR and its influence on national burden estimates.

**Specific directives for new research appropriate (2/2):** Urges use of population-specific RR data and highlights limitations in using pooled global estimates for local PAF modeling.

| Moon et al. (2013) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 19/22 | 86.4% | Well-conducted meta-analysis quantifying RR and PAF for asbestos-related lung cancer; Item 5 – no appraisal of included studies; Item 6 – unclear if appraisal was independent; Item 9 – no explicit publication bias assessment. |
