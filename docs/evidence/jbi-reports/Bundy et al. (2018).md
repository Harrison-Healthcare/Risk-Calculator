# Bundy et al. (2018)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Inclusion criteria clearly defined (2/2):** Used NHANES 2005–2014 cycles, including participants aged 20–44 years with data on blood pressure and cardiovascular risk.

**Study subjects and setting described in detail (2/2):** Population-based U.S. sample with detailed sociodemographic stratification.

**Exposure measured in valid and reliable way (2/2):** Blood pressure readings taken via standardized NHANES protocols.

**Objective, standard criteria used for measurement (2/2):** Cardiovascular risk scores were calculated using AHA guidelines.

**Confounding factors identified (2/2):** Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors considered.

**Strategies for confounding factors stated (1/2):** Multivariable regression used, but details on variable selection and model diagnostics are limited.

**Outcomes measured validly and reliably (2/2):** Clinical assessments and questionnaire-based data from NHANES protocols ensure reliability.

**Appropriate statistical analysis used (1/2):** Complex survey design accounted for, but potential residual confounding or multicollinearity not discussed.
