# Janket et al. (2003)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aimed to assess whether periodontal disease is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and identify reasons for inconsistent findings .

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included cohort studies with ≥100 participants, exposure preceding outcome, and RR/CI reported or calculable .

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** MEDLINE and manual reference searches performed; included abstracts to reduce publication bias .

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Bibliographic screening supplemented electronic searches; 60% overlap in duplicate search confirms thoroughness .

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Custom quality rubric (Table II, p. 561) scored study design, exposure/outcome validity, confounding control, generalizability, and follow-up duration.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Four researchers independently extracted and validated effect estimates and quality scores .

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Inter-reviewer agreement tested (r = 0.9); standardized extraction and consensus resolution used .

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird), stratified and meta-regression analyses performed .

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Begg’s test (p = .18) showed no significant publication bias.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Overall RR for CVD = 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08–1.32); stronger effects for stroke (RR = 2.85) and adults ≤65 years (RR = 1.44).

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Recommends biomarker studies and better exposure classification; suggests maintenance rather than surgical intervention as a preventive strategy.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Janket et al. (2003) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses | 22/22 | 100% | Meta-analysis of 9 cohort studies (n=107,011; 7,035 CVD events). Periodontal disease associated with 19% increased CVD risk overall, 44% in those ≤65 years, and 185% for stroke. Stratified and metaregression analyses account for age, confounding, and exposure misclassification. All checklist criteria fully satisfied. |
