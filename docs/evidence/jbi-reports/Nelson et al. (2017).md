### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

Checklist Used: JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses (11 items)

**Is the review question clearly and explicitly stated? (2/2):** Yes. Aims were clearly defined: to evaluate childhood maltreatment's impact on depression incidence, severity, onset age, course, and treatment response.

**Were the inclusion criteria appropriate for the review question? (2/2):** Yes. Included adult samples with validated measures of maltreatment and depression, requiring at least one relevant outcome.

**Was the search strategy appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Searched three major databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS), included grey literature (reference lists, reviews), and multilingual sources.

**Were the sources and resources used to search for studies adequate? (2/2):** Yes. Extensive search yielded 10,482 studies with full transparency of screening and selection via PRISMA diagram (Fig. 1).

**Were the criteria for appraising studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Risk of bias assessed using robust quality ratings (0–4 composite score based on validity of both maltreatment and depression measures), detailed in Table 2.

**Was critical appraisal conducted by two or more reviewers independently? (2/2):** Yes. Data extraction and appraisal were independently conducted by two reviewers using a standardized form; discrepancies resolved by consensus.

**Were there methods to minimize errors in data extraction? (2/2):** Yes. Structured extraction template, dual coding, and reconciliation procedures were followed throughout the review.

**Were the methods used to combine studies appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Used random-effects meta-analysis, robust variance estimation (RVE), and logit transformations. Separate models used where end-point interdependence existed.

**Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? (2/2):** Yes. Funnel plots, Egger’s test, Duval & Tweedie’s trim-and-fill, and Peter’s test were used; bias was minor and transparently reported in Table 1.

**Were recommendations for policy and/or practice supported by the reported data? (2/2):** Yes. Findings supported early detection and targeted intervention, emphasizing emotional abuse/neglect as key clinical indicators.

**Were the specific directives for new research appropriate? (2/2):** Yes. Authors recommended future prospective, multi-variable analyses and emphasized exploring moderators like gender, trauma chronicity, and comorbidities.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nelson et al. (2017) | JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews | 22/22 | 100% | Comprehensive and methodologically rigorous meta-analysis of 184 studies examining childhood maltreatment and adult depression. Clear eligibility, robust bias control, subgroup/meta-regression analyses, and nuanced handling of interdependent outcomes meet all JBI criteria. |
