# Strazzullo et al. (2009)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly and explicitly stated (2/2):** Clearly aimed to assess associations between salt intake and risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Limited to prospective studies with ≥3 years of follow-up and data on stroke or CVD outcomes across salt intake levels.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Extensive multi-database search (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library) covering 1966–2008.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Multiple major databases searched plus hand-searching of references.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Used the Downs & Black checklist to assess study quality (mean score: 15.5/19).

**Critical appraisal conducted independently (2/2):** Two authors independently reviewed studies with arbitration by a third reviewer.

**Methods to minimize errors in data extraction (2/2):** Dual data extraction with consensus process; authors contacted for clarification when needed.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Inverse-variance random-effects model used with meta-regression and sensitivity analysis.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and Egger’s regression used; no significant asymmetry found (p > 0.25 for stroke and CVD).

**Recommendations supported by reported data (2/2):** Showed 23% increased stroke risk and 17% CVD risk with high salt intake; recommendations consistent with evidence.

**Specific directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Highlighted need for stronger long-term studies and salt reduction interventions at the population level.
