# Li et al. (2019)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly framed to evaluate the dose–response association between OCP use and risk of stroke (total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic).

**Inclusion criteria appropriate (2/2):** Only observational studies with specific exposure parameters (estrogen dose, duration of use/cessation) and ORs for stroke outcomes were included.

**Search strategy appropriate (2/2):** Extensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and reference lists up to September 2018.

**Sources/resources adequate (2/2):** Used three major databases and contacted authors for missing data.

**Criteria for appraising studies described (2/2):** Used Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS); scores reported, with nearly all studies rated high quality.

**Critical appraisal by ≥2 reviewers (2/2):** Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and resolved differences by discussion.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Dual data extraction with verification, and a standardized form was used.

**Methods used to combine studies appropriate (2/2):** Random-effects meta-analysis, restricted cubic splines, and dose–response modeling applied appropriately.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Begg’s and Egger’s tests conducted; no significant publication bias found (p > 0.1).

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Increased estrogen dose and longer OCP use elevated stroke risk, while cessation reduced it—conclusions clearly aligned with results.

**Specific directives for future research (2/2):** Emphasized need for updated studies using modern low-dose OCPs, and to assess effect modification by risk factors like smoking.
