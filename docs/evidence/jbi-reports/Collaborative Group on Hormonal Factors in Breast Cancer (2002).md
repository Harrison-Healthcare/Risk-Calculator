# Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer (2002)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Clearly defined objective to assess the impact of breastfeeding on breast cancer risk.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included cohort and case-control studies with â‰¥100 cases and reproductive data; standardized eligibility across all 47 studies.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Search strategy not explicitly detailed in this publication but builds on an established, previously published collaborative data series.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Covered global literature including both published and two unpublished datasets; 45 published studies cited.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Defined based on ability to provide individual-level data on breastfeeding, births, and timing.

**Critical appraisal conducted by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Study used central collection and harmonization of data, ensuring consistency and reducing bias.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Central checking and standardization of individual-level data ensured data quality and consistency across studies.

**Appropriate methods used to combine studies (2/2):** Employed stratified Mantel-Haenszel and floating absolute risk methods to control for heterogeneity and confounding.

**Likelihood of publication bias assessed (2/2):** Comparisons with 10 excluded studies and assessment of consistency across study designs addressed this risk.

**Recommendations supported by data (2/2):** Clear, evidence-based conclusions linking longer breastfeeding with reduced breast cancer risk; consistent dose-response.

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Called for studies in populations with long breastfeeding durations and research on underlying mechanisms.
