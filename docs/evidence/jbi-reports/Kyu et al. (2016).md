# Kyu et al. (2016)

### Item-by-item Scoring Justification:

**Review question clearly stated (2/2):** Aimed to quantify dose–response relationships between total physical activity and five NCD outcomes using GBD framework.

**Appropriate inclusion criteria (2/2):** Included prospective cohort studies reporting ≥3 PA exposure levels and relative risks for specified outcomes.

**Appropriate search strategy (2/2):** Systematic search of PubMed and Embase up to April 2016 with additional reference screening.

**Adequate sources searched (2/2):** Searched two major databases, supplemented by prior systematic reviews and grey literature tracking.

**Criteria for appraising studies appropriate (2/2):** Studies had to provide detailed exposure categorization and report on specific diseases with appropriate adjustment for confounders.

**Critical appraisal by two reviewers independently (2/2):** Reviewers independently screened and extracted data, resolving discrepancies through consensus.

**Methods to minimize data extraction errors (2/2):** Used standardized extraction forms; multiple authors verified coding and PA harmonization.

**Appropriate methods to combine studies (2/2):** Bayesian meta-regression modeling used to estimate continuous dose-response curves for each outcome.

**Publication bias assessed (2/2):** Funnel plots and heterogeneity assessed; although not all bias tests were reported, sensitivity analyses were conducted.

**Recommendations supported by data (1/2):** Findings consistently supported inverse PA-disease associations, but lacked a detailed assessment of how bias may have impacted results (e.g., residual confounding, self-report error).

**Directives for future research appropriate (2/2):** Called for better PA exposure measures and studies in low- and middle-income countries.
